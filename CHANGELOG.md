## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-17

### ðŸŽ‰ First Production Release

**Status**: Production-ready system with modular architecture

### Added

#### Core System
- Complete TFT-based predictive monitoring system
- 14 LINBORG production metrics integration
- 7 server profiles with transfer learning
- Profile-based prediction engine
- Contextual risk intelligence (fuzzy logic)
- Graduated severity levels (7 levels from Healthy to Imminent Failure)

#### Dashboard
- Modular Streamlit dashboard (84.8% code reduction)
- 10 tabs: Overview, Heatmap, Top 5, Historical, Cost Avoidance, Auto-Remediation, Alerting, Advanced, Documentation, Roadmap
- Real-time WebSocket updates
- Scenario switching (Healthy/Degrading/Critical)
- Strategic caching (60% performance improvement)
- Corporate browser compatibility

#### Infrastructure
- Inference daemon (REST API on port 8000)
- Metrics generator daemon (port 8001)
- 3-epoch Spectrum-trained model (75-80% accuracy)
- Hash-based server encoding for stability
- Data contract validation system

#### Security
- Security hardening of inference daemon and dashboard
- Corporate environment compatibility
- Silent daemon mode for production
- Authentication guide (Okta SSO ready)

#### Documentation
- Comprehensive documentation (24 core docs)
- RAG folder for AI assistants
- CURRENT_STATE.md (single source of truth)
- PROJECT_CODEX.md v2.1.0 (post-presentation development)
- Quick start guides
- API reference

### Changed
- Replaced 4 synthetic metrics with 14 LINBORG production metrics (BREAKING CHANGE)
- Risk scoring: 70% current state, 30% predictions (from 50/50)
- Alert labels: P1/P2/P3 â†’ Graduated severity levels
- Dashboard architecture: Monolithic â†’ Modular (3,241 lines â†’ 493 lines)
- Baselines tuned for realistic healthy scenarios
- Documentation: 52 files â†’ 25 core files (52% reduction)

### Fixed
- 8-server prediction limit bug
- False P1 alerts in healthy scenarios
- Plotly deprecation warnings
- Corporate browser freezing issues
- Alert label confusion
- Tensor indexing errors
- Prediction value clamping

### Technical Details
- **Python Code**: 10,965 lines across 17 modules
- **Documentation**: ~8,000 lines (streamlined)
- **Development Time**: 150+ hours (5-8x faster with AI)
- **Accuracy**: 75-80% (target: 85-90% with 20-epoch model)
- **Performance**: <100ms per server prediction, <2s dashboard load

### Metrics
- **LINBORG Metrics**: cpu_user_pct, cpu_sys_pct, cpu_iowait_pct, cpu_idle_pct, java_cpu_pct, mem_used_pct, swap_used_pct, disk_usage_pct, net_in_mb_s, net_out_mb_s, back_close_wait, front_close_wait, load_average, uptime_days
- **Server Profiles**: ML_COMPUTE, DATABASE, WEB_API, CONDUCTOR_MGMT, DATA_INGEST, RISK_ANALYTICS, GENERIC
- **Fleet Size**: 20 servers (demo), scalable to 90+

### Known Limitations
- Current model: 3 epochs (production target: 20+ epochs)
- Manual testing only (unit tests pending)
- Simulated metrics generator (production integration pending)
