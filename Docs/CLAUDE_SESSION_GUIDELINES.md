## üìã Session Management Protocol

### **Session Start Checklist**

When beginning a new session:

1. **Record Session Start Time**
   ```markdown
   **Session Start:** [TIME] (e.g., 7:30 AM, 2:15 PM)
   **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
   ```

2. **Quick Status Check**
   - Review last session summary (if exists)
   - Check git status
   - Review recent commits
   - Identify any incomplete tasks

3. **Greet and Orient**
   - Acknowledge the time of day
   - Reference what was accomplished in previous session
   - Ask about priorities for this session

4. **Read Core Documentation (ESSENTIAL ONLY)**
   - [ESSENTIAL_RAG.md](ESSENTIAL_RAG.md) - ‚≠ê Complete system reference
   - [SESSION_2025-10-11_SUMMARY.md](SESSION_2025-10-11_SUMMARY.md) - Latest session
   - [PROJECT_CODEX.md](PROJECT_CODEX.md) - Development rules
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT** read `archive/` directory - Historical docs only

---

### **During Session**

1. **Track Progress**
   - Use TodoWrite for multi-step tasks
   - Mark tasks complete as soon as finished
   - Update session notes as you work

2. **Document Decisions**
   - Record why certain approaches were chosen
   - Note any technical debt or "TODO" items
   - Save important findings immediately

3. **Create Clear Artifacts**
   - Code changes with clear comments
   - Documentation updates
   - Validation reports for major changes

---

### **Session End Protocol**

When wrapping up (user says "call it a night", "done for today", etc.):

1. **Record Session End Time**
   ```markdown
   **Session End:** [TIME] (e.g., 5:45 PM, 11:30 PM)
   **Duration:** [HOURS] hours (e.g., 4.5 hours)
   ```

2. **Create Session Summary Document**
   - Filename: `SESSION_YYYY-MM-DD_SUMMARY.md`
   - Location: `Docs/`
   - Template: See [Session Summary Template](#session-summary-template) below

3. **Update PROJECT_SUMMARY.md**
   - Add session changes to "Change Notes" section
   - Update "Current System State" if applicable
   - Update "Last Updated" timestamp

4. **Git Status Check**
   - List modified files
   - Suggest commit message if changes warrant it
   - Note any uncommitted work

5. **Set Clear Next Steps**
   - List 3-5 actionable next steps
   - Mark priority/blocking tasks
   - Note what's ready vs. what needs work

## üéØ Best Practices

### **Time Tracking**
- Always ask for start time if not provided
- Record when user indicates end of session
- Calculate and note session duration
- Track cumulative time on major features

### **Session Types**

**Morning Sessions (AM)**
- Focus on planning and architecture
- Review overnight thoughts/ideas
- Set clear goals for the day
- Fresh perspective on hard problems

**Afternoon Sessions (PM)**
- Implementation and testing
- Building on morning plans
- Incremental progress
- Mid-session check-ins

**Evening Sessions (PM/Night)**
- Wrap up in-progress work
- Document decisions made
- Prepare for next session
- Avoid starting major new features

### **Communication Style by Time**

**Morning (Before 12 PM)**
```
"Good morning! I see we left off with [X] yesterday around [TIME].
Ready to tackle [Y] today?"
```

**Afternoon (12 PM - 5 PM)**
```
"We've been working for [X] hours. Made good progress on [Y].
Should we continue or switch to [Z]?"
```

**Evening (After 5 PM)**
```
"We've been at this for [X] hours since [START_TIME].
Getting close to wrapping up? Let me summarize what we've done..."
```

## üéì Example Session Markers

### **Good Session Start**
```
üëã Good morning!

I see we started yesterday around 7:30 AM and wrapped up at 5:45 PM
(~10 hours). We successfully fixed the schema mapping and validated
training works.

Today's session start: 8:15 AM

What would you like to tackle first today? I recommend:
1. Training the new model (30-40 min)
2. Testing end-to-end workflow
3. Exploring online learning implementation

What's your priority?
```

### **Good Session End**
```
