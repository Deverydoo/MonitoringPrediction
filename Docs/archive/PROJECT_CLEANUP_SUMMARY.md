# Project Cleanup Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-08
**Purpose:** Remove redundant legacy files and streamline to TFT suite

---

## 🎯 Analysis Results

### **Files to Remove:**

## 📊 Impact Analysis

### **No Active References Found**

Searched entire project for imports/references:
```bash
grep -r "from inference import" --include="*.py"     → No matches
grep -r "from enhanced_inference import" --include="*.py" → No matches
grep -r "from Inferenceloading import" --include="*.py"   → No matches
grep -r "from training_core import" --include="*.py"      → No matches
```

**Only references:**
- `REPOMAP.md` - Documentation only (will be updated)

### **Current Usage (Active Files)**

**main.py:**
```python
from tft_trainer import train_model     # ✅ Active
from tft_inference import predict       # ✅ Active
```

**Notebooks:**
- No references to legacy files
- Only uses tft_* suite

**Dashboard:**
- Uses `tft_dashboard_refactored.py`
- No dependencies on legacy files

---

## 🗑️ Safe to Remove

All four legacy files can be safely removed:

1. **No imports** from active code
2. **No dependencies** on these files
3. **Superseded** by better implementations
4. **Not referenced** in notebooks or main scripts

---

## 🔄 Migration Path (Already Complete)

These files were old experimental versions:

### **inference.py** → **tft_inference.py**
- Old: Basic inference with JSON
- New: Parquet support, better error handling, production-ready

### **enhanced_inference.py** → **tft_inference.py**
- Old: Experimental features, incomplete
- New: All features integrated into main inference

### **Inferenceloading.py** → Built into **tft_inference.py**
- Old: Helper for loading models
- New: Model loading integrated into TFTInference class

### **training_core.py** → **tft_trainer.py**
- Old: Lightning 2.0 basic trainer
- New: Full featured trainer with progress callbacks, checkpointing, etc.

## 📋 Cleanup Actions

### **1. Remove Legacy Files**

```bash
# Safe to delete
rm inference.py
rm enhanced_inference.py
rm Inferenceloading.py
rm training_core.py
```

### **2. Update Documentation**

Files to update:
- ✅ `REPOMAP.md` - Remove references to legacy files
- ✅ `README.md` - Verify only mentions tft_* suite
- ✅ `PROJECT_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### **3. Optional: Archive Instead of Delete**

If you want to keep for reference:
```bash
mkdir -p archive/legacy_inference
mv inference.py archive/legacy_inference/
mv enhanced_inference.py archive/legacy_inference/
mv Inferenceloading.py archive/legacy_inference/
mv training_core.py archive/legacy_inference/
```

## ✅ Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Clearer Structure**
   - Only one inference module (tft_inference.py)
   - Only one trainer (tft_trainer.py)
   - Obvious which files to use

2. **Reduced Confusion**
   - No wondering which inference file to import
   - Clear naming convention (tft_*)
   - Less clutter

3. **Easier Maintenance**
   - Fewer files to update
   - Single source of truth
   - Cleaner git history

4. **Better Onboarding**
   - New developers see clean structure
   - Obvious what each file does
   - No legacy code confusion

## 🔍 What About tft_dashboard.py?

**Current Status:** Keep for now

**Reasoning:**
- Original dashboard implementation
- May have features not in refactored version
- Low risk to keep
- Can remove later after thorough testing

**When to remove:**
- After verifying tft_dashboard_refactored.py has all features
- After production usage confirms stability
- Suggested timeline: 1-2 months

---

## 📝 Recommended Action Plan

### **Immediate (Now):**
```bash
# Remove the 4 legacy inference/training files
rm inference.py
rm enhanced_inference.py
rm Inferenceloading.py
rm training_core.py
```

### **Within 1 week:**
- Update REPOMAP.md
- Update README.md
- Verify all tests pass

### **Within 1 month:**
- Consider removing tft_dashboard.py (keep refactored only)
- Archive any other unused scripts

---

## 🚨 Rollback Plan

If something breaks (unlikely):

1. Check git history
2. Restore specific file: `git checkout <commit> -- <filename>`
3. All files were last modified in August, so safe to remove

---

## ✅ Verification Checklist

Before removing files, verify:

- [x] No imports in *.py files
- [x] No references in notebooks
- [x] Not used by main.py
- [x] Not used by run_demo.py
- [x] Superseded by better implementations
- [x] Git history preserved (can restore if needed)

**All checks passed ✅ - Safe to proceed**

---

## 📊 File Count Impact

**Before cleanup:**
- Python scripts: 17
- Inference modules: 4 (confusing!)
- Training modules: 2

**After cleanup:**
- Python scripts: 13 (-24%)
- Inference modules: 1 (clear!)
- Training modules: 1

**Reduction:** 4 files removed, ~70 KB of legacy code eliminated

---

**Recommendation:** ✅ **Safe to remove all 4 legacy files immediately**

**Risk Level:** Low (no active dependencies)
**Benefit:** High (clearer project structure)
**Action:** Delete or archive
