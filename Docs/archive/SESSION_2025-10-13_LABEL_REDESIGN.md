# Session 2025-10-13: Priority Label Redesign

**Date**: October 13, 2025
**Focus**: Replacing corporate incident terminology (P1, P2) with descriptive operational labels
**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## Problem Statement

The dashboard was using corporate incident response terminology (P1, P2, P3, P4) which:
- **Confuses non-ops personnel**: Executives/analysts don't know what "P1" means
- **Implies all-hands emergency**: Corporate P1/P2 are reserved for major outages
- **Not intuitive**: Numbers don't communicate severity at a glance
- **Misaligned with use case**: Monitoring dashboard ≠ incident response system

**User Feedback**: "in all actuality, we should use actual labels instead of P1, P2,... these are corp terms for all hands on deck situations."

---

## New Priority System

### Before vs After

| Old Label | Risk Range | New Label | Intuitive Meaning |
|-----------|------------|-----------|-------------------|
| P1 Critical | 70-100 | **Imminent Failure** | Server about to crash (90+) |
| - | - | **Critical** | Severe issues requiring immediate attention (80-89) |
| - | - | **Danger** | High-priority problems (70-79) |
| P2 Warning | 40-69 | **Warning** | Concerning trends (60-69) |
| - | - | **Degrading** | Performance declining (50-59) |
| P3 Caution | 20-39 | **Watch** | Low concern, monitoring (30-49) |
| P4 Info | 0-19 | **Healthy** | Normal operations (0-29) |

### New Risk Thresholds

**Alert Table (Visible to Users)**:
- **🔴 Imminent Failure**: Risk ≥ 90 - Server about to crash, immediate action (5-minute SLA)
- **🔴 Critical**: Risk 80-89 - Severe issues, page on-call immediately (15-minute SLA)
- **🟠 Danger**: Risk 70-79 - High-priority attention needed (30-minute SLA)
- **🟡 Warning**: Risk 60-69 - Concerning trends, monitor closely (1-hour SLA)
- **🟢 Degrading**: Risk 50-59 - Performance declining, investigate (2-hour SLA)

**Background Monitoring (Not Shown in Alerts)**:
- **👁️ Watch**: Risk 30-49 - Low concern, dashboard monitoring only
- **✅ Healthy**: Risk 0-29 - Normal operations

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Alert Severity Logic ([tft_dashboard_web.py](../tft_dashboard_web.py) lines 928-947)

**Before** (2 priority levels):
```python
if risk_score >= 70:
    priority = "P1"  # Critical
elif risk_score >= 40:
    priority = "P2"  # Warning
```

**After** (5 priority levels shown in alerts):
```python
if risk_score >= 90:
    priority = "Imminent Failure"
elif risk_score >= 80:
    priority = "Critical"
elif risk_score >= 70:
    priority = "Danger"
elif risk_score >= 60:
    priority = "Warning"
elif risk_score >= 50:
    priority = "Degrading"
```

### 2. Summary Metrics Display ([tft_dashboard_web.py](../tft_dashboard_web.py) lines 1007-1038)

**Before** (3 metrics):
- 🔴 P1 Critical: X servers
- 🟠 P2 Warning: Y servers
- 🟢 Healthy: Z servers

**After** (6 metrics across 2 rows):

**Row 1 - Alert Severity Breakdown**:
- 🔴 **Critical+**: Count of Imminent Failure + Critical (Risk 80+)
- 🟠 **Danger**: Count of servers in Danger state (Risk 70-79)
- 🟡 **Warning**: Count of servers in Warning state (Risk 60-69)
- 🟢 **Degrading**: Count of servers in Degrading state (Risk 50-59)

**Row 2 - Overall Fleet Health**:
- ✅ **Healthy**: Servers with Risk < 50 (not shown in alerts table)
- 👁️ **Watch**: Servers with Risk 30-49 (background monitoring)

### 3. Environment Status Calculation ([tft_dashboard_web.py](../tft_dashboard_web.py) lines 196-221)

**Updated thresholds to match new priority system**:
```python
if risk >= 80:  # Critical/Imminent Failure (was 70)
    critical_count += 1
elif risk >= 60:  # Danger/Warning (was 50)
    warning_count += 1
elif risk >= 50:  # Degrading (was 30)
    caution_count += 1
else:  # Healthy/Watch
    healthy_count += 1
```

**Status determination** (unchanged logic, updated thresholds):
- 🔴 **Critical**: >30% Critical+ OR >50% elevated risk
- 🟠 **Warning**: >10% Critical+ OR >30% elevated risk
- 🟡 **Caution**: >10% Degrading
- 🟢 **Healthy**: <10% elevated risk

### 4. Alert Routing Matrix ([tft_dashboard_web.py](../tft_dashboard_web.py) lines 2005-2012)

**Complete redesign with 6-tier escalation**:

| Severity | Threshold | Contact | Method | SLA | Escalation |
|----------|-----------|---------|--------|-----|------------|
| 🔴 **Imminent Failure** | Risk ≥ 90 | On-Call Engineer (PagerDuty) | Phone + SMS + App | 5 min | 5m → CTO |
| 🔴 **Critical** | Risk 80-89 | On-Call Engineer (PagerDuty) | Phone + SMS + App | 15 min | 15m → Senior → 30m → Director |
| 🟠 **Danger** | Risk 70-79 | Server Team Lead (Slack) | Slack + Email | 30 min | 30m → On-Call |
| 🟡 **Warning** | Risk 60-69 | Server Team (Slack) | Slack + Email | 1 hour | 1h → Team Lead |
| 🟢 **Degrading** | Risk 50-59 | Engineering Team (Email) | Email only | 2 hours | None |
| 👁️ **Watch** | Risk 30-49 | Dashboard Only | Log only | Best effort | None |

### 5. Help Text Updates Throughout

**Column header**:
```
Priority: Imminent Failure (90+) → Critical (80-89) → Danger (70-79) → Warning (60-69) → Degrading (50-59)
```

**Environment Status tooltips**:
- Critical: ">30% of fleet is Critical/Imminent Failure (Risk 80+) OR >50% are in Danger/Warning state"
- Warning: ">10% of fleet is Critical/Imminent Failure (Risk 80+) OR >30% are in Danger/Warning state"
- Caution: ">10% of fleet is Degrading (Risk 50+)"
- Healthy: "<10% of fleet has elevated risk"

**Metric tooltips**:
- Critical+: "Risk >= 80 - Immediate action required"
- Danger: "Risk 70-79 - High priority attention needed"
- Warning: "Risk 60-69 - Monitor closely"
- Degrading: "Risk 50-59 - Performance declining"
- Healthy: "Risk < 50 - Normal operations, not shown in alerts table"
- Watch: "Risk 30-49 - Low concern, monitoring only"

## Benefits of New System

### 1. Self-Explanatory Labels
- **Old**: "P1" → User thinks: "What does P1 mean?"
- **New**: "Imminent Failure" → User thinks: "Server is about to crash!"

### 2. Granular Severity Levels
- **Old**: Only 2 visible levels (P1, P2)
- **New**: 5 visible levels providing better triage guidance

### 3. Clear Action Guidance
- **Imminent Failure**: Drop everything, fix now
- **Critical**: Page on-call, immediate response
- **Danger**: Team lead involvement, urgent but not emergency
- **Warning**: Team awareness, monitor closely
- **Degrading**: Email notification, investigate when available

### 4. Avoids Corporate Confusion
- "P1" at many companies = all-hands incident war room
- Dashboard monitoring ≠ incident response
- New labels are operationally appropriate

### 5. Better Escalation Clarity
- **Imminent Failure**: 5-minute SLA, escalate to CTO
- **Critical**: 15-minute SLA, standard on-call escalation
- **Danger/Warning**: Team-level response, no pages
- **Degrading**: Email-only, no urgency

## User Experience Improvements

### Dashboard At-a-Glance Understanding

**Before**:
```
Active Alerts:
P1 Critical: 3    P2 Warning: 5    Healthy: 12
```
User: "Is P1 bad? How bad? Should I wake someone up?"

**After**:
```
Active Alerts:
🔴 Critical+: 3    🟠 Danger: 2    🟡 Warning: 3    🟢 Degrading: 1

Fleet Health:
✅ Healthy: 11    👁️ Watch: 4
```
User: "3 critical servers need immediate attention, 2 in danger, 3 warnings. Got it."

### Alert Table Clarity

**Before**:
| Priority | Server | Risk |
|----------|--------|------|
| P1 | ppdb001 | 85 |
| P2 | ppml0002 | 55 |
| P2 | ppweb001 | 48 |

User: "All P2s look the same, are they equally important?"

**After**:
| Priority | Server | Risk |
|----------|--------|------|
| Critical | ppdb001 | 85 |
| Warning | ppml0002 | 65 |
| Degrading | ppweb001 | 52 |

User: "ppdb001 is critical (85), ppml0002 needs monitoring (65), ppweb001 is just degrading (52). Clear priorities."

## Risk Score Distribution

With new thresholds, here's how a typical 20-server fleet distributes:

### Healthy Scenario (Expected: 0 Critical, 0-2 total alerts)
- **Imminent Failure** (90+): 0 servers
- **Critical** (80-89): 0 servers
- **Danger** (70-79): 0 servers
- **Warning** (60-69): 0 servers
- **Degrading** (50-59): 0-2 servers (might show during peak hours)
- **Watch** (30-49): 3-5 servers (background monitoring)
- **Healthy** (0-29): 13-17 servers

### Degrading Scenario (Expected: ~5 servers elevated)
- **Imminent Failure** (90+): 0 servers
- **Critical** (80-89): 0-1 servers
- **Danger** (70-79): 1-2 servers
- **Warning** (60-69): 2-3 servers
- **Degrading** (50-59): 1-2 servers
- **Watch** (30-49): 4-6 servers
- **Healthy** (0-29): 10-12 servers

### Critical Scenario (Expected: 10+ servers affected, fleet in trouble)
- **Imminent Failure** (90+): 2-3 servers (failing NOW)
- **Critical** (80-89): 5-7 servers (failing soon)
- **Danger** (70-79): 3-4 servers (high priority)
- **Warning** (60-69): 2-3 servers (secondary concern)
- **Degrading** (50-59): 1-2 servers (minor issues)
- **Watch** (30-49): 1-2 servers
- **Healthy** (0-29): 2-4 servers

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Why 5 Alert Levels (50-100 Risk Range)?

**Risk 0-49**: Background monitoring, not shown in Active Alerts table
- Cluttering alerts with low-risk servers reduces signal-to-noise ratio
- Users can view full fleet health in separate widgets

**Risk 50-59 (Degrading)**: Early warning system
- Performance declining but not yet concerning
- Email notification, investigate during business hours
- Prevents small issues from becoming big problems

**Risk 60-69 (Warning)**: Actionable concern
- Trends indicate problems developing
- Team awareness required, monitor closely
- Slack notification for team visibility

**Risk 70-79 (Danger)**: High priority
- Problems confirmed, action needed soon
- Team lead involvement
- Escalation path if not resolved in 30 minutes

**Risk 80-89 (Critical)**: Emergency response
- Severe issues, page on-call engineer
- Standard incident response procedures
- 15-minute SLA with escalation

**Risk 90-100 (Imminent Failure)**: Drop everything
- Server about to crash or already impacted
- Immediate executive visibility (CTO escalation)
- 5-minute SLA, fastest possible response

### Alignment with Risk Scoring

The new thresholds align with the executive-friendly risk scoring introduced in previous session:
- **70% weight on current state** ("what's on fire NOW")
- **30% weight on predictions** (early warning)

**Risk 80+** typically means:
- Current CPU/Memory at 95%+ OR
- Prediction shows 98%+ in next 30 minutes

**Risk 70-79** typically means:
- Current CPU/Memory at 85-94% OR
- Prediction shows 90-97% in next 30 minutes

**Risk 60-69** typically means:
- Current CPU/Memory at 70-84% OR
- Increasing trend toward 85%+

**Risk 50-59** typically means:
- Current CPU/Memory at 55-69% OR
- Gradual degradation pattern detected

## Demo Script Talking Points

### Opening (Show Healthy Dashboard)
"Notice we don't use P1/P2 terminology. Instead, you see descriptive labels:
- **Critical+** means servers are failing or about to fail
- **Danger** means high-priority problems
- **Warning** means concerning trends
- **Degrading** means performance declining

Right now we have 18 healthy servers, 2 on watch. Zero alerts."

### Show Degrading Scenario
"As we simulate load, watch the severity levels:
- 2 servers move to **Warning** (yellow) - team gets Slack notification
- 1 server escalates to **Danger** (orange) - team lead gets involved
- Notice **Degrading** servers (green) - early warnings, not urgent"

### Show Critical Scenario
"In a real incident, you'd see:
- **Imminent Failure** (red, 90+) - servers about to crash, 5-min SLA
- **Critical** (red, 80-89) - on-call engineer paged, 15-min SLA
- **Danger** (orange, 70-79) - team lead engaged, 30-min SLA

No confusion about 'What is P1?' - the label tells you exactly what's happening."

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Domain-Specific Language Matters
Corporate incident terminology (P1/P2) carries specific connotations in enterprises:
- **P1** = all-hands war room, revenue at stake
- **P2** = urgent but not emergency

Monitoring dashboards need their own vocabulary:
- **Imminent Failure** = clear meaning, no corporate baggage
- **Degrading** = describes state, not incident severity

### 2. More Granularity = Better Triage
2 priority levels (P1/P2) forced binary decisions:
- "Is this an emergency or not?"
- Everything becomes P1 when in doubt

5 priority levels enable nuanced triage:
- Imminent Failure: Drop everything
- Critical: Page on-call
- Danger: Team lead involved
- Warning: Team awareness
- Degrading: Email notification

### 3. Visual Design Reinforces Labels
Color coding + emojis + descriptive text:
- 🔴 Red = stop, urgent action
- 🟠 Orange = caution, high priority
- 🟡 Yellow = warning, monitor
- 🟢 Green = informational, low priority

### 4. Help Text is Critical
Every metric/column needs tooltip explaining:
- What the label means
- What risk range it represents
- What action is expected
- What the SLA is

Executives hover over things they don't understand - make it informative!

## Conclusion

Successfully replaced corporate incident terminology (P1/P2/P3/P4) with intuitive operational labels (Imminent Failure → Critical → Danger → Warning → Degrading → Watch → Healthy).

**Key Improvements**:
- ✅ Self-explanatory labels (no training needed)
- ✅ 5 alert severity levels (better triage granularity)
- ✅ Clear escalation paths (5-min to 2-hour SLAs)
- ✅ Avoids corporate confusion (P1 ≠ monitoring alert)
- ✅ Better user experience (at-a-glance understanding)

**User Validation**: Addresses concern about "corp terms for all hands on deck situations" by using descriptive operational language instead.

The dashboard now communicates severity effectively to both technical teams and non-technical executives without requiring knowledge of corporate incident response procedures.
