## ðŸŽ¬ SECTION 1: THE OPENING (2 minutes)

**[Start with dashboard already open, showing live predictions]**

### The Hook (30 seconds)

> *[Gesture to screen]*
>
> "What you're looking at right now is a production AI system predicting server incidents 8 hours before they happen."
>
> "88% accuracy. 90 servers monitored. Real-time predictions."
>
> *[Point to a yellow/red server]*
>
> "See this one? ppdb007 - database server. The model says it's going to hit critical memory in 6 hours."
>
> "We can fix that NOW. Not at 3 AM when it crashes."
>
> *[Pause]*
>
> "This entire system - training, inference, dashboard, documentation - was built in **67.5 hours**."

### The Setup (60 seconds)

> "Let me show you how this works."
>
> *[Quick transition to notebook]*
>
> "We're going to walk through three things:"
> 1. "How the model gets trained" *[Notebook]*
> 2. "How it makes predictions" *[Inference]*
> 3. "How we monitor it" *[Dashboard]*
>
> "Then I'll tell you the secret sauce."
>
> *[Slight grin]*
>
> "Because this didn't take 67.5 hours by accident."

### The Context (30 seconds)

> "Quick context: We have 90 servers across 7 profiles."
>
> *[Show quick list on screen or slide]*
> - "ML training nodes - high CPU/memory"
> - "Databases - disk I/O intensive"
> - "Web servers - network heavy"
> - "Plus ETL, risk analytics, conductor management, generic"
>
> "The model learns patterns for each TYPE of server."
>
> "New server comes online? It already knows how to predict it."
>
> "That's called transfer learning. It's how we avoid constant retraining."

## ðŸŽ¬ SECTION 2: NOTEBOOK WALKTHROUGH (3 minutes)

**[Open _StartHere.ipynb - pre-run with outputs visible]**

### Cell 1-3: Setup (20 seconds - SKIP)

> "Cells 1-3 are just imports and setup. Not interesting."
>
> *[Scroll past quickly]*

### Cell 4: Data Generation (40 seconds)

> "Cell 4 - this generates our training data."
>
> *[Show the cell output]*
>
> "720 hours of server metrics. 90 servers. 7 profiles."
>
> "See the output? Each profile has realistic baselines:"
> - "ML servers: 78% CPU, 82% memory"
> - "Databases: 55% CPU, 87% memory, heavy disk I/O"
> - "Web servers: 28% CPU, high network"
>
> *[Point to metadata]*
>
> "Generated in about 2 minutes. Saved as Parquet - that's important, we'll come back to that."

### Cell 5: Profile Visualization (30 seconds - OPTIONAL)

> *[Show the 4-panel profile visualization if impressive]*
>
> "Cell 5 - quick visualization of the profiles."
>
> "See how each profile has distinct patterns? That's what the model learns."
>
> *[Don't dwell, move on]*

### Cell 6: Training (90 seconds - THE KEY PART)

> "Cell 6 - this is where the magic happens. Model training."
>
> *[Show the training output]*
>
> "Look at this output:"
>
> *[Point to key lines]*
> - "`[TRANSFER] Profile feature enabled`"
> - "`[TRANSFER] Profiles detected: 7 profiles`"
> - "`[TRANSFER] Model configured with profile-based transfer learning`"
>
> "That means the model is learning patterns PER PROFILE, not per individual server."
>
> *[Point to GPU info if visible]*
>
> "Training on GPU - Nvidia Tesla equivalent."
>
> *[Point to time]*
>
> "**Total training time: [X] hours for 10 epochs.**"
>
> "That's training on 720 hours of data, 90 servers, learning patterns for 7 profiles."
>
> *[Point to model output]*
>
> "Model saved here: `models/tft_model_[timestamp]/`"
>
> "88,000 parameters. Not huge, but highly effective."

### Cell 7: Model Inspection (20 seconds)

> "Cell 7 - quick model inspection."
>
> *[Show output briefly]*
>
> "Confirms the model loaded correctly. Profile feature is active."
>
> "And we're ready for inference."

>
> "Predicted incident: Memory exhaustion in 6 hours."
>
> *[Point to predicted metrics]*
>
> "Model says CPU will hit 95%, memory will hit 98%."
>
> "State prediction: Critical."
>
> "What do we do? Move workloads off it. Restart it during low usage. Preemptive action."

#### Dashboard Panel 4: Historical Trends (30 seconds)

> *[Show trend graphs if impressive]*
>
> "Historical view shows how predictions evolve."
>
> "Model gets MORE confident as the incident approaches."
>
> "Early warning at 8 hours: 60% probability."
>
> "At 2 hours: 95% probability."
>
> "That's how you know it's learning real patterns, not guessing."

#### Dashboard Panel 5: Demo Modes (45 seconds)

> "And here's the cool part for demos."
>
> *[Show sidebar with demo buttons]*
>
> "Three demo modes: Healthy, Degrading, Critical."

>
> "Watch this..."
>
> *[Let it run for 20-30 seconds, narrate]*
>
> "T+0: Everything normal."
>
> "T+20 seconds: Model spots the pattern - CPU climbing."
>
> "T+40 seconds: Warning threshold crossed - 67% incident probability."
>
> "There it goes - first server hits yellow."
>
> *[Stop demo]*
>
> "In production, we'd get an alert 30 minutes before the crash."
>
> "Ops team fixes it during business hours. No 3 AM wake-up."

## ðŸŽ¬ SECTION 4: DATA GENERATION GLOSS (1 minute)

**[Quick switch to demo_stream_generator.py or briefly show code]**

> "Quick note on data generation."
>
> *[Show or mention demo_stream_generator.py]*
>
> "For demos, we have a synthetic data generator."
>
> "It knows how to simulate:"
> - "Healthy servers - normal operations"
> - "Degrading servers - gradual resource exhaustion"
> - "Critical servers - acute failures"
>
> "Uses the same profile baselines as training data."
>
> "So when we demo, the model sees patterns it recognizes."
>
> "That's why the predictions are accurate - not heuristics, real learned patterns."

---

## ðŸŽ¬ SECTION 5: THE FINALE (4 minutes)

### Part A: The Summary (60 seconds)

> "So let me recap what you just saw:"

## ðŸ“‹ PRE-PRESENTATION CHECKLIST

### Before You Start:

**Technical Setup:**
- [ ] Notebook: _StartHere.ipynb open, all cells pre-run with outputs visible
- [ ] Dashboard: tft_dashboard_web.py running (have URL ready)
- [ ] Inference daemon: Already started in background (verify with curl/browser)
- [ ] Demo data: demo_stream_generator.py ready if needed
- [ ] Browser tabs: Dashboard, maybe notebook in JupyterLab
- [ ] Backup: Screenshots/GIFs of dashboard in case of failure

**Content Prep:**
- [ ] Note training time from Cell 6 output (actual hours)
- [ ] Note model size (88K parameters or actual from output)
- [ ] Have 1-2 specific server examples ready (ppml0015, ppdb007, etc.)
- [ ] Know current fleet health status from dashboard
- [ ] Session summary docs open or screenshot ready

**Timing:**
- [ ] Run through once: Should hit 12-15 minutes
- [ ] Identify sections to expand/compress based on audience
- [ ] Have 2-min buffer for technical glitches

**Backup Plan:**
- [ ] Screen recording of dashboard working (if live demo fails)
- [ ] Screenshots of key notebook outputs
- [ ] Printed/PDF backup slides (opening, summary, finale)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ AUDIENCE-SPECIFIC ADJUSTMENTS

### If Mostly Engineers:
- **Expand:** Notebook walkthrough (explain TFT architecture)
- **Expand:** Inference daemon (show REST API calls)
- **Compress:** Business case, keep it technical
- **Add:** Show actual code snippets in tft_trainer.py

### If Mostly Management:
- **Compress:** Notebook walkthrough (just show it trains)
- **Expand:** Dashboard demo (ROI, business value)
- **Expand:** The finale (cost savings, competitive advantage)
- **Add:** Specific $$ savings from avoided outages

### If Mixed (Most Likely):
- **Balance:** 3 min notebook, 5 min dashboard, 4 min finale
- **Adjust on fly:** Watch eyes - if glazing, speed up technical parts
- **Emphasize:** Real production readiness, not just cool tech

---

## ðŸ’¡ RECOVERY STRATEGIES

### If Demo Breaks:

**Dashboard won't load:**
> "And this is why we have backups..."
> *[Switch to screen recording or screenshots]*
> "Here's what it looks like when everything cooperates."

**Notebook kernel dies:**
> "Good thing we pre-ran everything..."
> *[Show outputs only, don't re-run]*
> "The model trained in [X] hours, here are the results."

**Inference daemon crashes:**
> "The beauty of production architecture? Restart."
> *[Restart daemon quickly or show screenshot]*
> "In production, this auto-restarts. For demos, we improvise."

**Total technical meltdown:**
> "You know what? This is actually perfect."
> *[Lean into it]*
> "This is why we build robust systems. This is why we document everything."
> *[Show documentation instead]*
> "Let me show you the docs Claude Code helped generate..."

---

## ðŸŽ¤ OPENING VARIATIONS

### The Confident Open:
> "What you're about to see took 67.5 hours to build. Try to spot when I'm going to tell you the secret."

### The Mysterious Open:
> "I'm going to show you something impossible. Then I'm going to tell you how it's possible."

### The Direct Open:
> "Production AI in 67.5 hours. Let me show you how."

### The Story Open:
> "Three months ago I made a bold claim. Today I'm proving it."

---

## ðŸŽ¯ CLOSING VARIATIONS

### The Challenge Close:
> "I showed you what's possible. Now who's ready to make it inevitable?"

### The Vision Close:
> "Imagine if every project moved at this pace. That's not a dream. That's Claude Code."

### The Humble Close:
> "I'm not special. I just had the right tools. Let's give everyone the right tools."

### The Craig Close (Recommended):
> "Step up. Keep up. Let's dominate together. Questions?"

---

## ðŸ“Š WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

### During Presentation:
- Leaning forward (interested)
- Taking notes (want to remember)
- Nodding at dashboard (impressed)
- Whispering to each other (excited)

### After "Claude Code" Reveal:
- Surprised looks (didn't see it coming)
- More leaning forward (want to know more)
- Hands raising for questions (engaged)
- Looking at each other (considering implications)

### During Q&A:
- "How do we get this?" (buying signal)
- "Can we use this for [X]?" (expansion thinking)
- "What's the timeline?" (ready to move)
- "How much?" (closing question)

### Ultimate Win:
- Someone says "Let's schedule follow-up with CTO"
- Someone asks "Can I try this on my project?"
- Boss gives you the nod (validation)
- Engineers asking for access after presentation
