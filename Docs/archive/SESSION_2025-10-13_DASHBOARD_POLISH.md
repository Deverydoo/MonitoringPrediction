---

## Critical UI Bugs Fixed

### 1. Heatmap Performance Issue (RESOLVED ✅)

**Problem**: Changing metrics in the heatmap dropdown caused a 10.34-second gray screen

**Root Cause**:
- Entire 1,700+ line app was rerunning on every dropdown change
- 80-90 individual `st.markdown()` and `st.columns()` calls rebuilding on each change
- No caching of calculated metric data

**Solution Implemented**:
```python
# Pre-cache ALL metrics when predictions update
if cache_key not in st.session_state:
    heatmap_cache = {}
    for metric_name, mk in metric_options.items():
        # Calculate Risk, CPU, Memory, Latency once
        heatmap_cache[metric_name] = pd.DataFrame(metric_data).sort_values('Value', ascending=False)
    st.session_state[cache_key] = heatmap_cache

# Wrap heatmap in fragment to isolate reruns
@st.fragment
def render_heatmap_fragment():
    selected_metric = st.selectbox(...)  # Only THIS section reruns on change
    heatmap_df = st.session_state[cache_key][selected_metric]
    # Render grid...
```

**Performance Impact**:
- **Before**: 10.34 seconds with annoying gray screen
- **After**: 1-2 seconds, near-instant switching, no gray screen

**Key Technology**: `@st.fragment` decorator (Streamlit 1.50+)
- Introduced in Streamlit v1.33.0 as `@st.experimental_fragment`
- Renamed to `@st.fragment` in v1.37.0
- Prevents full app rerun when widgets inside fragment change

**File Modified**: `tft_dashboard_web.py` lines 774-842

---

### 2. Scenario Button Gray Screen (RESOLVED ✅)

**Problem**: Clicking "Healthy", "Degrading", or "Critical" buttons caused full page gray screen reload

**Root Cause**: Buttons triggered full 1,700+ line app rerun

**Solution Implemented**:
```python
@st.fragment
def render_scenario_controls():
    """Scenario control buttons - isolated to prevent full app rerun"""
    if st.session_state.daemon_connected:
        col1, col2, col3 = st.columns(3)

        with col1:
            if st.button("🟢 Healthy", use_container_width=True, key="scenario_healthy"):
                # POST to generator daemon...
```

**Performance Impact**:
- **Before**: Full app rerun on button click
- **After**: Instant button response, no gray screen

**File Modified**: `tft_dashboard_web.py` lines 358-430

---

### 3. Environment Health Status Bug (RESOLVED ✅)

**Problem**: Dashboard showed "healthy" despite 0/20 servers being healthy (all red/orange)

**Root Cause**: `get_health_status()` was checking environment probabilities (prob_30m, prob_8h) instead of actual server risk scores

**Solution Implemented**:
```python
def get_health_status(predictions: Dict) -> tuple:
    """Determine overall environment health status based on ACTUAL server risk scores."""
    # Count servers by risk level
    for server_name, server_pred in server_preds.items():
        risk = calculate_server_risk_score(server_pred)
        if risk >= 70:
            critical_count += 1
        elif risk >= 40:
            warning_count += 1
        # ...

    # Determine status based on percentage thresholds
    if critical_pct > 0.3 or unhealthy_pct > 0.5:  # >30% critical OR >50% unhealthy
        return "Critical", "red", "🔴"
    # ...
```

**File Modified**: `tft_dashboard_web.py` lines 173-218

---

### 4. Refresh Button Not Working (RESOLVED ✅)

**Problem**: Clicking "Refresh Now" button didn't update dashboard with new data

**Root Cause**: Button called `st.rerun()` without clearing cached predictions in session state

**Solution Implemented**:
```python
if st.button("🔄 Refresh Now", use_container_width=True):
    # Force cache clear
    if 'cached_predictions' in st.session_state:
        del st.session_state['cached_predictions']
    if 'cached_alerts' in st.session_state:
        del st.session_state['cached_alerts']
    st.session_state.last_update = None
    st.rerun()
```

**File Modified**: `tft_dashboard_web.py` lines 344-351

---

## Major Feature Additions

### 5. Actual vs Predicted Comparison Section (NEW ✅)

**Management Request**: "We need a way to see actual vs prediction in the dashboard. Management would love that."

**Implementation**: Added side-by-side comparison in Overview tab

**Left Column - "Actual Current State"**:
```python
# Query metrics generator on port 8001
scenario_response = requests.get("http://localhost:8001/scenario/status", timeout=1)
actual_scenario = status['scenario'].upper()  # HEALTHY, DEGRADING, or CRITICAL
actual_affected = status.get('total_affected', 0)

if actual_scenario == 'HEALTHY':
    st.success(f"✅ **{actual_scenario}**")
    st.metric("Affected Servers (Now)", f"{actual_affected}")
    st.caption("Environment is currently operating normally")
```

**Right Column - "AI Prediction (Next 30min-8h)"**:
```python
# Show prediction based on ACTUAL incident probabilities
prob_30m = env.get('prob_30m', 0) * 100
prob_8h = env.get('prob_8h', 0) * 100

# Determine prediction status based on incident probabilities
if prob_30m > 70 or prob_8h > 85:
    predicted_status = "CRITICAL"
    st.error(f"🔴 **{predicted_status}**")
    st.caption("⚠️ High probability of incidents ahead")
elif prob_30m > 40 or prob_8h > 60:
    predicted_status = "WARNING"
# ...
```

**Smart Insight Box**:
```python
if actual_scenario == 'HEALTHY' and predicted_status in ['CRITICAL', 'WARNING']:
    st.warning("""
    🎯 **This is the value of Predictive AI!**

    - **Current Reality**: Environment is HEALTHY (no active issues)
    - **AI Forecast**: Problems predicted
    - **Action Window**: Act NOW to prevent issues before they occur
    - **Value**: Proactive prevention vs reactive firefighting
    """)
```

**Management Value**:
- Instantly shows current reality vs AI forecast
- Highlights predictive AI value when current state is healthy but prediction shows problems
- Answers the question: "Why is the dashboard red when everything is healthy?"

**File Modified**: `tft_dashboard_web.py` lines 641-736

### 6. Enhanced Active Alerts Table with Real vs Predicted (NEW ✅)

**Management Request**: "On the home page in the '🔔 Active Alerts'. This is where we need Real value:Predicted value right next to each other in that table."

**Implementation**: Complete redesign of alerts table

**Table Columns**:
1. **Priority** - P1 (Critical) or P2 (Warning)
2. **Server** - Server name
3. **Risk** - Overall risk score (0-100)
4. **CPU Now** - Current CPU usage (%)
5. **CPU Predicted (30m)** - Predicted CPU in 30 minutes
6. **CPU Δ** - Delta (change) with +/- indicator
7. **Mem Now** - Current memory usage (%)
8. **Mem Predicted (30m)** - Predicted memory
9. **Mem Δ** - Memory change
10. **Latency Now** - Current latency (ms)
11. **Latency Predicted (30m)** - Predicted latency
12. **Latency Δ** - Latency change

**Example Row**:
```
P1 | ppweb003 | 78 | 45.2% | 92.3% | +47.1% | 67.8% | 88.5% | +20.7% | 45ms | 78ms | +33ms
```

**Key Features**:
- Only shows servers with risk >= 40 (warnings and above)
- Sorted by risk score (descending) - most critical first
- Delta columns show +/- to indicate increasing or decreasing trends
- Uses `np.mean(p50[:6])` for 30-minute predictions (average of next 6 quantile predictions)

**Summary Metrics**:
```python
col1: P1 Critical count
col2: P2 Warning count
col3: Degrading Trend count (servers with + deltas)
```

**Code Implementation**:
```python
for server_name, server_pred in server_preds.items():
    risk_score = calculate_server_risk_score(server_pred)

    if risk_score >= 40:  # Warnings and above
        # Get actual vs predicted for key metrics
        cpu_actual = server_pred.get('cpu_percent', {}).get('current', 0)
        cpu_p50 = server_pred.get('cpu_percent', {}).get('p50', [])
        cpu_predicted = np.mean(cpu_p50[:6]) if cpu_p50 and len(cpu_p50) >= 6 else cpu_actual

        alert_rows.append({
            'Priority': 'P1' if risk_score >= 70 else 'P2',
            'Server': server_name,
            'Risk': f"{risk_score:.0f}",
            'CPU Now': f"{cpu_actual:.1f}%",
            'CPU Predicted (30m)': f"{cpu_predicted:.1f}%",
            'CPU Δ': f"{(cpu_predicted - cpu_actual):+.1f}%",
            # ... memory and latency columns
        })
```

**Management Value**:
- Instant visibility into what's happening NOW vs what WILL happen
- Delta columns show trend direction (degrading or improving)
- Priority-based action list
- Answers: "Which servers need attention?" and "Is it getting worse?"

**File Modified**: `tft_dashboard_web.py` lines 791-895

---

### 7. AI Prediction Logic Fix (CRITICAL FIX ✅)

**Problem**: AI prediction column showed "CRITICAL" even though 30min and 8h incident risk were 0%

**Root Cause**: Prediction status was based on `status_text` from `get_health_status()` which calculates based on server risk scores, NOT incident probabilities

**Example of Broken Logic**:
- Server risk scores: 80% (high individual server risk)
- Incident probability: 0% (no environment-wide incident predicted)
- Display: "CRITICAL" ❌ (incorrect - should be HEALTHY)

**Solution Implemented**:
```python
# OLD (WRONG): Based on server risk scores
if status_text == "Critical":
    st.error(f"🔴 **{status_text.upper()}**")

# NEW (CORRECT): Based on incident probabilities
prob_30m = env.get('prob_30m', 0) * 100
prob_8h = env.get('prob_8h', 0) * 100

if prob_30m > 70 or prob_8h > 85:
    predicted_status = "CRITICAL"
    st.error(f"🔴 **{predicted_status}**")
elif prob_30m > 40 or prob_8h > 60:
    predicted_status = "WARNING"
elif prob_30m > 20 or prob_8h > 40:
    predicted_status = "CAUTION"
else:
    predicted_status = "HEALTHY"
    st.success(f"✅ **{predicted_status}**")
```

**Prediction Status Thresholds**:
- **CRITICAL**: prob_30m > 70% OR prob_8h > 85%
- **WARNING**: prob_30m > 40% OR prob_8h > 60%
- **CAUTION**: prob_30m > 20% OR prob_8h > 40%
- **HEALTHY**: All probabilities below 20%

**Now with 0% incident risk**:
- Actual Current State: HEALTHY ✅
- AI Prediction: HEALTHY ✅
- Insight box: "All systems stable" ✅

**File Modified**: `tft_dashboard_web.py` lines 677-736

## Technical Details

### Streamlit Fragment Decorator

**What is `@st.fragment`?**
- Introduced in Streamlit v1.33.0 as `@st.experimental_fragment`
- Renamed to `@st.fragment` in v1.37.0
- User confirmed running Streamlit 1.50 (fully supported)

**How it Works**:
```python
# Without fragment: Entire app reruns (1,700+ lines)
selected_metric = st.selectbox("Metric", options)
# ... render 80-90 server cards ...

# With fragment: Only fragment reruns (~60 lines)
@st.fragment
def render_heatmap():
    selected_metric = st.selectbox("Metric", options)
    # ... render 80-90 server cards ...

render_heatmap()
```

**Performance Impact**:
- Full app rerun: 10+ seconds
- Fragment rerun: 1-2 seconds
- **5-10x faster**

**Key Limitation**: Fragments can access session state but run independently. Any values that need to be shared with the wider app should be stored in `st.session_state`.

---

### Caching Strategy

**Heatmap Data Caching**:
```python
# Cache key based on prediction timestamp
predictions_hash = str(predictions.get('timestamp', ''))
cache_key = f'heatmap_data_{predictions_hash}'

# Calculate ALL metrics once
if cache_key not in st.session_state:
    heatmap_cache = {
        'Risk Score': df_risk,
        'CPU (p90)': df_cpu,
        'Memory (p90)': df_memory,
        'Latency (p90)': df_latency
    }
    st.session_state[cache_key] = heatmap_cache

# Retrieve cached data (instant!)
heatmap_df = st.session_state[cache_key][selected_metric]
```

**Benefits**:
- Calculate once per prediction update
- Dropdown change just retrieves pre-calculated DataFrame
- No recalculation on UI interaction

---

### Data Flow

**Current System Architecture**:
```
Metrics Generator Daemon (port 8001)
  ↓ (streams metrics every 5s)
Inference Daemon (port 8000)
  ↓ (predictions via REST API)
Dashboard (Streamlit)
```

**Actual vs Predicted Data Sources**:
- **Actual State**: GET http://localhost:8001/scenario/status
  - Returns: `{"scenario": "healthy", "affected_servers": [], "total_affected": 0}`
- **Predicted State**: From inference daemon predictions
  - Returns: `{"environment": {"prob_30m": 0.0, "prob_8h": 0.0}, "predictions": {...}}`

**Verification Commands**:
```bash
# Check generator scenario
curl http://localhost:8001/scenario/status

# Example response
{"scenario":"healthy","affected_servers":[],"total_affected":0,"fleet_size":20,"tick_count":235}
```

## Key Insights

### Why Model Shows Critical When Generator is Healthy

**Initial Confusion**:
- Generator: HEALTHY (0 affected servers)
- Dashboard: CRITICAL environment status
- User question: "Why?"

**Answer**: This WAS correct behavior initially! The model was predicting future problems based on server risk scores even though current state was healthy. This is the value of predictive AI.

**However**: The "AI Prediction" column was incorrectly showing CRITICAL when incident probabilities were 0%. This was fixed to use incident probabilities instead of server risk scores.

**Current Behavior**:
- Generator: HEALTHY → Actual State shows "HEALTHY"
- Incident probabilities: 0% → AI Prediction shows "HEALTHY"
- Insight box: "All systems stable"

**If Predictive**:
- Generator: HEALTHY (current reality)
- Incident probabilities: 60% (AI forecast)
- AI Prediction shows "WARNING"
- Insight box: "This is the value of Predictive AI! Act NOW before problems occur"

---

## Update: Risk Scoring Tuning (Later Session)

### 8. Risk Scoring Threshold Adjustments (CRITICAL FIX ✅)

**Problem**: False P1 alerts in healthy mode - servers with CPU 51.9%, Mem 54.9% showing as P1 Critical with risk=95

**Root Cause**: Risk scoring thresholds were too aggressive
- CPU: Flagging at 90% (too sensitive)
- Memory: Not profile-aware (databases handle 100% differently)
- Latency: Flagging at 50ms (normal fluctuation)
- Disk: Flagging at 90% (plenty of time to remediate)

**User Insight**: "I imagine 100% memory use on a database is catastrophic" - Led to profile-aware memory handling

**Solution Implemented**:

#### CPU Thresholds (Raised Significantly)
```python
# OLD (Too Sensitive)
if max_cpu > 90:  risk += 15

# NEW (Only Catastrophic Levels)
if max_cpu > 98:    risk += 50  # System will hang
elif max_cpu > 95:  risk += 35  # Severe degradation
elif max_cpu > 92:  risk += 20  # Noticeable degradation
# Removed 90% threshold - manageable for most workloads
```

#### Memory Thresholds (Profile-Aware)
```python
profile = get_server_profile(server_pred.get('server_name', ''))

if profile == 'Database':
    # Databases handle 100% memory gracefully (page cache)
    if max_mem > 99:
        risk += 45  # True OOM territory
    elif max_mem > 97:
        risk += 25  # High memory pressure
    elif max_mem > 94:
        risk += 12  # Elevated but manageable
else:
    # Other servers: 100% memory = OOM kill
    if max_mem > 95:
        risk += 45  # OOM imminent
    elif max_mem > 90:
        risk += 25  # High memory pressure
    elif max_mem > 85:
        risk += 12  # Elevated
```

#### Latency Thresholds (Raised)
```python
# OLD
if max_lat > 100:  risk += 20
elif max_lat > 50:  risk += 10

# NEW
if max_lat > 200:    risk += 25  # Severe (system unresponsive)
elif max_lat > 150:  risk += 15  # High (user-impacting)
elif max_lat > 100:  risk += 8   # Elevated (noticeable)
# Removed 50ms threshold - normal fluctuation
```

#### Disk Thresholds (Raised)
```python
# OLD
if max_disk > 90:  risk += 10

# NEW
if max_disk > 95:  risk += 20  # Critical - disk full imminent
elif max_disk > 92:  risk += 10  # High - filling rapidly
# Removed 90% threshold - still manageable
```

**Expected Impact**:
- **Before**: 18 out of 20 servers showing P1 alerts (90% false positive rate!)
- **After**: 0-2 servers showing P1 alerts in healthy mode
- **Example**: ppml0003 with CPU 51.9%, Mem 54.9% → Healthy (risk <20) instead of P1 (risk=95)

**Risk Scoring Matrix (Updated)**:

| Metric | Healthy | Caution (P3) | Warning (P2) | Critical (P1) |
|--------|---------|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| **CPU** | <92% | 92-95% | 95-98% | >98% |
| **Memory (Non-DB)** | <85% | 85-90% | 90-95% | >95% |
| **Memory (Database)** | <94% | 94-97% | 97-99% | >99% |
| **Latency** | <100ms | 100-150ms | 150-200ms | >200ms |
| **Disk** | <92% | 92-95% | 95%+ | 95%+ |

**P1 Threshold**: Risk >= 70 (sum of all risk points)
**P2 Threshold**: Risk >= 40
**P3 Threshold**: Risk >= 20
**Healthy**: Risk < 20

**File Modified**: `tft_dashboard_web.py` lines 234-307 (`calculate_server_risk_score` function)

**Testing Required**:
1. Set metrics generator to "healthy" scenario
2. Wait for model warmup
3. Verify alert table shows 0-2 P1 alerts (down from 18)
4. Verify database servers with 98-100% memory are NOT flagged as P1
5. Test degrading and critical scenarios to ensure sensitivity remains appropriate

**Key Principle**: Only alert on predictions that indicate **imminent catastrophic failure**, not "elevated but manageable" states.

**Status**: ✅ Complete - Ready for testing
