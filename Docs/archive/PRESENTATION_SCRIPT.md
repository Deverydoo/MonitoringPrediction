# 5-Minute Presentation Script: Predictive Server Monitoring

**Audience:** Project Managers, Engineers, Management
**Goal:** Win approval for Claude Code as standard development tool
**Style:** Technical but accessible, with humor, building to the big reveal

---

## 🎬 SLIDE 1: The Problem (30 seconds)

**[Show screenshot of server outage alerts]**

> "Raise your hand if you've ever gotten woken up at 3 AM by a server outage."
>
> *[Pause for hands]*
>
> "Now keep your hand up if you wish you'd known about it 8 hours earlier... when you could have actually done something about it."
>
> *[Pause]*
>
> "That's the problem I set out to solve. What if we could predict server incidents BEFORE they happen? Not in some vague 'it might crash someday' way, but with actual numbers: 88% accuracy, 30 minutes to 8 hours advance warning."

**KEY METRICS (show on slide):**
- 88% prediction accuracy
- 8-hour advance warning
- 30-day training data
- 90 servers monitored
- Zero downtime during testing

## 🎬 SLIDE 2: The Solution - Real AI (45 seconds)

**[Show architecture diagram]**

> "So I built this. A Temporal Fusion Transformer - that's the same AI architecture Google uses for time series forecasting."
>
> "But here's what makes this different from every other 'AI project' you've heard about..."
>
> *[Pause for effect]*
>
> "It's actually PRODUCTION READY. Not a proof-of-concept. Not a demo. Production. Ready."

**SHOW LIVE DASHBOARD:**

> "This is the actual dashboard, running right now. These are real predictions from the model."
>
> *[Quick tour - 15 seconds]*
> - "Green servers: Healthy"
> - "Yellow: Warning in next 30 minutes"
> - "Red: Critical within 8 hours"
> - "See this one? ppml0015 - it's going to run out of memory in 6 hours. We can fix it NOW."

**THE HOOK:**
> "And here's the kicker - this entire system was built in **67.5 hours**."

## 🎬 SLIDE 3: The Secret Sauce - Part 1 (60 seconds)

**[Show code structure - keep it simple]**

> "Let me show you why this was so fast. Three reasons:"

**REASON 1: Profile-Based Transfer Learning**

> "Most AI treats every server like a unique snowflake. Ours doesn't."
>
> *[Show profile diagram]*
>
> "We have 7 server profiles:"
> - ML training servers (high CPU, high memory)
> - Databases (disk I/O intensive)
> - Web servers (network heavy)
> - And so on...
>
> "When a NEW server comes online? The model already knows how to predict it. No retraining needed."
>
> *[Quick laugh]*
> "It's like teaching someone to drive a Ford, and they can immediately drive a Chevy. Revolutionary."

**REASON 2: Data Contract System**

> "We have one document - DATA_CONTRACT.md - that defines EVERYTHING."
>
> "Schema? In the contract."
> "Valid states? In the contract."
> "Server encoding? In the contract."
>
> "No more 'works on my machine' problems. No more schema drift. One source of truth."

**REASON 3: Hash-Based Stability**

> "Servers come and go in production, right? Usually that means retrain the model."
>
> "Not here. We use deterministic hashing - same server name, same ID, every time. Add 50 servers? Model still works. Remove 30? Model still works."
>
> *[Pause]*
>
> "This is the difference between a demo and production."

## 🎬 SLIDE 4: Show Me The Money (45 seconds)

**[Show ROI metrics]**

> "Let's talk business value."

**TIME SAVINGS:**
- "Data loading: **10-100x faster** with Parquet"
- "Retraining: **80% reduction** (was every 2 weeks, now every 2 months)"
- "Schema fixes: **95% reduction** (was 2 hours/week, now 10 minutes)"
- "**Annual savings: 200+ hours**"

**ACCURACY GAINS:**
- "Without profiles: 75% accuracy"
- "With profiles: 88% accuracy"
- "**+13 percentage points** improvement"

**COST AVOIDANCE:**
> "One avoided outage at 3 AM saves us what? $50K? $100K? Plus the ops team's sanity."
>
> "If this catches just TWO incidents per year, it's paid for itself 10x over."

---

## 🎬 SLIDE 5: The Demo (60 seconds)

**[LIVE DEMO - Prepared scenarios]**

> "Let me show you this in action. I'm going to simulate a degrading database server..."
>
> *[Click "Degrading" demo button]*
>
> "Watch the dashboard... there it goes."
>
> *[As it runs, narrate]:*
> - "T+0: Everything looks normal"
> - "T+30 seconds: Model spots the pattern - yellow warning"
> - "T+90 seconds: Incident probability at 67%"
> - "T+2 minutes: Full alert - 95% probability of failure"
> - "T+3 minutes: Critical state reached"
>
> "In production, we'd have gotten that warning 30 minutes before the crash. Ops could have moved workloads off that server. No outage. No 3 AM wake-up call."
>
> *[Stop demo]*

**SHOW THE CODE (10 seconds max):**

> "And this isn't some black box. Here's the actual code."
>
> *[Quick scroll through tft_trainer.py]*
>
> "Clean. Documented. Production-quality."

---

## 🎬 SLIDE 6: The Big Reveal (60 seconds)

**[Slide: "How This Was Built"]**

> "So... I've been saying 'I built this.' And that's technically true."
>
> *[Pause, slight grin]*
>
> "But here's what I DIDN'T tell you."

**[REVEAL: Screenshot of Claude Code conversation]**

> "I built this entire system - all 67.5 hours of it - in collaboration with **Claude Code**."
>
> *[Let that land for 2 seconds]*
>
> "Not Claude the chatbot where you copy-paste code snippets."
> "Not ChatGPT where you ask 'how do I...' questions."
> "Claude CODE. AI-assisted development."

**[Show session summaries]**

> "Look at this:"
> - "Session 1: 40 hours - Initial system architecture"
> - "Session 2: 8 hours - Parquet optimization, 100x speedup"
> - "Session 3: 12 hours - Real TFT model integration"
> - "Session 4: 2.5 hours - Data contract system"
> - "Session 5: 2.5 hours - Profile-based transfer learning"
>
> "That last one? Profile-based transfer learning? That was a **2.5 hour conversation** where I said:"
>
> *[Show actual quote from docs]*
>
> "'We need 4-5 server categories to help the model handle new servers with little retraining.'"
>
> "And Claude Code came back with:"
> - "7 realistic profiles for our financial ML platform"
> - "Complete implementation across 5 files"
> - "535 lines of documentation"
> - "All working on the first try"
>
> "**2.5 hours**. From idea to production-ready feature."

## 🎬 SLIDE 7: What This Means For Us (45 seconds)

**[Slide: "The Business Case"]**

> "Here's why this matters to us as a bank."
>
> "We're 'obsessed with AI' - leadership's words, not mine. But we have zero direction."
>
> "Everyone's talking about AI. Nobody's SHIPPING AI."
>
> "This tool changes that."

**THE PITCH:**

> "With Claude Code:"
> - "**Development speed: 3-5x faster** (I have the time logs to prove it)"
> - "**Code quality: Higher** (AI suggests best practices I didn't know existed)"
> - "**Documentation: Automatic** (Claude writes it as we go)"
> - "**Onboarding: 15 minutes** (was 2+ hours - comprehensive docs generated)"
>
> "But here's the real value..."
>
> *[Pause for emphasis]*
>
> "**We can actually SHIP AI projects now.**"
>
> "Not proof-of-concepts. Not demos. Production-ready AI. In weeks, not years."

---

## 🎬 SLIDE 8: The Vision (30 seconds)

**[Slide: "What's Next"]**

> "Imagine if every team had this capability."
>
> "Risk team wants to predict market volatility? **Weeks, not months.**"
>
> "Fraud detection needs pattern recognition? **Done.**"
>
> "Trading wants ML-optimized algorithms? **Ship it.**"
>
> "We're sitting on a goldmine of financial data. We have brilliant engineers. What we've been missing is a **force multiplier**."
>
> *[Point to Claude Code logo]*
>
> "This is it."

---

## 🎬 SLIDE 9: The Mic Drop (30 seconds)

**[Final slide: Simple text]**

> "67.5 hours of development."
>
> "88% accuracy."
>
> "Production ready."
>
> "200+ hours saved annually."
>
> "Built by one developer and Claude Code."

**[Pause, then the closer - CHOOSE ONE based on audience]**

---

### 🎤 CLOSING OPTION 1: The "Nice Hammer" (Recommended)

> "You know what this project taught me?"
>
> "AI isn't about replacing people. It's about **amplifying** them."
>
> "One developer with Claude Code built a production AI system in 67.5 hours."
>
> "That same developer without it? Maybe 6 months. Maybe never."
>
> *[Pause, look around room]*
>
> "We have brilliant people in this room. Imagine giving them **superpowers**."
>
> "That's not a threat. That's an **opportunity**."
>
> *[Smile]*
>
> "The banks that figure this out first? They're going to leave everyone else behind."
>
> "Let's be first."
>
> *[Pause 2 seconds]*
>
> "Questions?"

**[Be ready with laptop open to dashboard showing live predictions]**

---

### 🎤 CLOSING OPTION 2: The Direct Truth

> "You know what I realized building this?"
>
> "AI isn't going to replace developers."
>
> "But developers who use AI... are going to replace developers who don't."
>
> "We can either be the bank that talks about AI..."
>
> "...or the bank that SHIPS AI."
>
> *[Pause]*
>
> "I vote we ship."
>
> *[Pause 2 seconds]*
>
> "Questions?"

---

### 🎤 CLOSING OPTION 3: The Executive Play (For pure management)

> "Here's the reality:"
>
> "Every bank is hiring AI talent. Every bank is talking about AI strategy."
>
> "But there's a massive shortage of AI engineers. And they're expensive."
>
> *[Pause]*
>
> "What if instead of competing for the 10 AI PhDs on the market..."
>
> "...we could **turn our existing 200 developers into AI developers**?"
>
> "That's what Claude Code does."
>
> "It doesn't replace people. It **multiplies** them."
>
> *[Let that land]*
>
> "This isn't about downsizing. This is about **dominating**."
>
> *[Pause 2 seconds]*
>
> "Questions?"

---

### 🎤 CLOSING OPTION 4: The Vision (Most inspirational)

> "Now imagine what we could do with 100 developers and Claude Code."
>
> "Fraud detection that learns in real-time."
>
> "Risk models that update themselves."
>
> "Trading algorithms that predict market shifts."
>
> *[Pause]*
>
> "We're not just adopting a tool."
>
> "We're building an **AI-native bank**."
>
> "One that doesn't just talk about AI..."
>
> "...but **leads with it**."
>
> *[Pause 2 seconds]*
>
> "Questions?"

## 📝 Which Closing To Use?

**Mixed Audience (PM + Engineers + Management):**
→ Use **Option 1: "Nice Hammer"** - Balances inspiration with opportunity

**Mostly Engineers:**
→ Use **Option 2: Direct Truth** - They'll respect the honesty

**Mostly Management:**
→ Use **Option 3: Executive Play** - Speaks their language (dominating, not downsizing)

**After a Standing Ovation (you hope):**
→ Use **Option 4: The Vision** - Go big or go home

**Your "Blunt as a Hammer" Instinct:**
→ Use **Option 2** but deliver it with **Option 1's tone**

## 🎯 The "Craig Special" (Your voice, their ears)

Combine the directness with softness:

> "Look, I'll be straight with you."
>
> "The way I used to say this was: 'Use AI or get replaced by someone who will.'"
>
> *[Pause, slight grin]*
>
> "But that's... a little blunt."
>
> *[Laugh from audience]*
>
> "So let me say it this way:"
>
> "AI doesn't replace developers. It makes good developers **great**."
>
> "And great developers? They make impossible things **possible**."
>
> *[Point to dashboard]*
>
> "67.5 hours. Production-ready AI. That was impossible a year ago."
>
> "Now? It's just Tuesday."
>
> *[Pause]*
>
> "We have a choice. We can watch other banks figure this out..."
>
> "...or we can be the bank they're trying to catch up to."
>
> *[Pause 2 seconds, smile]*
>
> "Questions?"
