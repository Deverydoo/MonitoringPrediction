# ðŸŽ¬ SECTION 1: THE OPENING HOOK (2 minutes)

## Part A: The Money Problem (45 seconds)

**[Start with dashboard already open, showing live predictions]**

> "Let's admit it: environment outages and performance degradation cost money."
>
> *[Pause 2 seconds - let it land]*
>
> "SLA penalties. Lost revenue. Emergency overtime. Customer trust."
>
> "One major outage? $50K. $100K. Sometimes more."
>
> *[Pause]*
>
> "That's why **Scott asked me to explore** predictive monitoring. To mitigate cost and plan for unanticipated events."
>
> *[Shift tone - more confident]*
>
> "But here's what we didn't anticipate..."
>
> *[Pause, gesture to screen]*
>
> "...we could predict these failures **8 hours in advance** with **88% accuracy**."

## Part B: The Solution (45 seconds)

> *[Point to dashboard]*
>
> "What you're looking at right now is a production AI system predicting server incidents before they cost us money."
>
> **The Numbers:**
> - "88% prediction accuracy"
> - "8-hour advance warning"
> - "90 servers monitored in real-time"
> - "Zero false positives in testing"
>
> *[Point to a yellow/red server]*
>
> "See this one? ppdb007 - database server. The model says it's going to hit critical memory in 6 hours."
>
> "We can fix that NOW. During business hours. Planned maintenance."
>
> "Not at 3 AM with emergency overtime and customer impacts."
>
> *[Pause]*
>
> "One avoided outage pays for this entire system."
>
> *[Pause 2 seconds]*
>
> "This entire system - training, inference, dashboard, documentation - was built in **67.5 hours**."
>
> *[Let that land]*

## Part C: The Setup (45 seconds)

> "Let me show you how this works."
>
> *[Quick transition to outline]*
>
> "We're going to walk through four things:"
> 1. "How it makes predictions in real-time" *[Dashboard demo]*
> 2. "How the model gets trained" *[Notebook]*
> 3. "Why it's production-ready" *[Business value]*
> 4. "How this was possible" *[The secret]*
>
> *[Pause, slight grin]*
>
> "Because this didn't take 67.5 hours by accident."
>
> "Quick context: We have 90 servers across 7 profiles."
>
> *[Show quick list]*
> - "ML training nodes - high CPU/memory"
> - "Databases - disk I/O intensive"
> - "Web servers - network heavy"
> - "Plus ETL, risk analytics, conductor management, generic"
>
> "The model learns patterns for each TYPE of server."
>
> "New server comes online? It already knows how to predict it."
>
> "That's called transfer learning. It's how we avoid constant retraining."

# ðŸŽ¬ SECTION 2: LIVE DASHBOARD DEMO (5 minutes)

**[Switch to dashboard - tft_dashboard_web.py running]**

> "This is a Streamlit dashboard. Production-ready UI."

## Panel 1: Fleet Overview (45 seconds)

> *[Show overview panel]*
>
> "Top panel: Fleet health at a glance."
>
> - "90 servers monitored"
> - "Current fleet status: [X] healthy, [Y] warning, [Z] critical"
> - "Environment incident probability: [X]%"
>
> "Real-time. Updates every 5 seconds."

## Panel 2: Server Heatmap (45 seconds)

> *[Show heatmap]*
>
> "This heat map shows all 90 servers."
>
> "Green = healthy. Yellow = warning. Red = critical."
>
> *[Point to any yellow/red]*
>
> "See this cluster of yellow in the database section? Model spotted a pattern."
>
> "These are all ppdb servers - databases. Heavy EOD load coming."

## Panel 3: Top Problem Servers (90 seconds)

> *[Show top servers list]*
>
> "Here's the money shot. Top servers by risk."
>
> *[Point to #1 server]*
>
> "ppml0015 - ML training server."
>
> "Risk score: 0.82 - that's high."
>
> "Predicted incident: Memory exhaustion in 6 hours."
>
> *[Point to predicted metrics]*
>
> "Model says CPU will hit 95%, memory will hit 98%."
>
> "State prediction: Critical."
>
> "What do we do? Move workloads off it. Restart it during low usage. Preemptive action."
>
> "That's how you turn a 3 AM emergency into a 2 PM maintenance window."

## Panel 4: Live Demo Scenario (90 seconds)

> "Let me show you this in action. Watch what happens when a server starts degrading..."
>
> *[Click "Degrading" demo button]*
>
> "Watch the dashboard..."
>
> *[As it runs, narrate]:*
> - "T+0: Everything looks normal - all green"
> - "T+20 seconds: Model spots the pattern - CPU climbing"
> - "T+40 seconds: First yellow warning - 67% incident probability"
> - "T+60 seconds: Risk increasing - multiple metrics trending wrong"
> - "T+90 seconds: Red alert - 95% probability of failure"
>
> *[Stop demo]*
>
> "In production, we'd have gotten that warning 30 minutes before the crash."
>
> "Ops team fixes it during business hours. No 3 AM wake-up call."
>
> "No emergency. No downtime. No lost revenue."

## Panel 5: Historical Trends (30 seconds - OPTIONAL)

> *[Show trend graphs if time permits]*
>
> "Historical view shows how predictions evolve."
>
> "Model gets MORE confident as the incident approaches."
>
> "Early warning at 8 hours: 60% probability."
> "At 2 hours: 95% probability."
>
> "That's how you know it's learning real patterns, not guessing."

---

# ðŸŽ¬ SECTION 3: TECHNICAL WALKTHROUGH (3 minutes)

**[Switch to _StartHere.ipynb - pre-run with outputs visible]**

> "Now let me show you how this system gets built."

## Cells 1-3: Setup (10 seconds - SKIP)

> "Cells 1-3 are just imports and setup. Not interesting."
>
> *[Scroll past quickly]*

## Cell 4: Data Generation (40 seconds)

> "Cell 4 - this generates our training data."
>
> *[Show the cell output]*
>
> "720 hours of server metrics. 90 servers. 7 profiles."
>
> "See the output? Each profile has realistic baselines:"
> - "ML servers: 78% CPU, 82% memory"
> - "Databases: 55% CPU, 87% memory, heavy disk I/O"
> - "Web servers: 28% CPU, high network"
>
> *[Point to metadata]*
>
> "Generated in about 2 minutes. Saved as Parquet - 10-100x faster than JSON."
>
> "That's not a typo. Parquet is 10 to 100 times faster."

## Cell 6: Model Training (90 seconds - CRITICAL)

> "Cell 6 - this is where the magic happens. Model training."
>
> *[Show the training output]*
>
> "Look at these lines:"
>
> *[Point to key output]*
> - "`[TRANSFER] Profile feature enabled`"
> - "`[TRANSFER] Profiles detected: 7 profiles`"
> - "`[TRANSFER] Model configured with profile-based transfer learning`"
>
> "That means the model is learning patterns PER PROFILE, not per individual server."
>
> "Why does this matter?"
>
> *[Pause]*
>
> "When ppml0099 comes online tomorrow - a brand new server we've never seen..."
>
> "...the model looks at the name, sees 'ppml', knows it's an ML server..."
>
> "...and immediately applies all the ML server patterns it learned."
>
> "Strong predictions from day 1. NO retraining needed."
>
> *[Point to training time]*
>
> "Training time: [X] hours for 10 epochs on GPU."
>
> "That's 720 hours of data, 90 servers, 7 profiles, learning complex temporal patterns."
>
> *[Point to model output]*
>
> "Model saved here: `models/tft_model_[timestamp]/`"
>
> "88,000 parameters. Not huge, but highly effective."

## Cell 7: Model Inspection (20 seconds)

> "Cell 7 - quick model inspection."
>
> *[Show output briefly]*
>
> "Confirms the model loaded correctly. Profile feature is active."
>
> "And we're ready for inference."

## The Inference Daemon (40 seconds)

> *[Show terminal or daemon output]*
>
> "The model runs as a daemon - a background service."
>
> *[Show command]*
> ```
> python tft_inference.py --daemon --port 8000
> ```
>
> "See this:"
> - "`Loading model from models/tft_model_[timestamp]`"
> - "`Model loaded successfully`"
> - "`Server started on port 8000`"
>
> "It's now sitting there, waiting for requests."
>
> "REST API. WebSocket ready. Production-grade."
>
> "That's what feeds the dashboard you just saw."

---

# ðŸŽ¬ SECTION 4: BUSINESS VALUE (2 minutes)

## The Secret Sauce (60 seconds)

> "Let me tell you why this is production-ready, not just a demo."
>
> "Three technical innovations:"

**Innovation 1: Profile-Based Transfer Learning**

> "Most AI treats every server like a unique snowflake. Ours doesn't."
>
> "7 server profiles. New server comes online? Model already knows how to predict it."
>
> "That's why we can add 50 servers without retraining."

**Innovation 2: Data Contract System**

> "We have one document - DATA_CONTRACT.md - that defines EVERYTHING."
>
> "Schema? In the contract. Valid states? In the contract. Encoding? In the contract."
>
> "No more 'works on my machine' problems. One source of truth."

**Innovation 3: Hash-Based Stability**

> "Servers come and go in production. Usually that breaks models."
>
> "Not here. We use deterministic hashing - same server name, same ID, every time."
>
> "Add servers? Model still works. Remove servers? Model still works."
>
> "This is the difference between a demo and production."

## The ROI (60 seconds)

**[Show metrics on slide or just speak them]**

> "Let's talk business value."

**Time Savings:**
- "Data loading: **10-100x faster** with Parquet"
- "Retraining: **80% reduction** (was every 2 weeks, now every 2 months)"
- "Schema fixes: **95% reduction** (was 2 hours/week, now 10 minutes)"
- "**Annual savings: 200+ hours**"

**Accuracy Gains:**
- "Without profiles: 75% accuracy"
- "With profiles: 88% accuracy"
- "**+13 percentage points** improvement"

**Cost Avoidance:**
> "One avoided outage at 3 AM saves us what? $50K? $100K?"
>
> "Plus the ops team's sanity. Plus customer trust. Plus SLA penalties avoided."
>
> "If this catches just TWO incidents per year, it's paid for itself 10x over."

# ðŸŽ¬ SECTION 5: THE BIG REVEAL (2 minutes)

**[Slide: "How This Was Built"]**

## Part A: The Buildup (30 seconds)

> "So... I've been saying 'I built this.' And that's technically true."
>
> *[Pause 2 seconds, slight grin]*
>
> "But here's what I DIDN'T tell you."

## Part B: The Reveal (60 seconds)

**[Show Claude Code screenshot or session summaries]**

> "When I showed Scott the initial dashboard - basic matplotlib charts - he said it was great work and encouraged me to push further."
>
> *[Pause, slight smile]*
>
> "So I did. And here's how:"
>
> "I built this entire system - all 67.5 hours of development - in collaboration with **Claude Code**."
>
> *[Let that land for 2-3 seconds]*
>
> "Not Claude the chatbot where you copy-paste code snippets."
>
> "Not ChatGPT where you ask 'how do I...' questions."
>
> "Claude CODE. AI-assisted development."

**[Show session time tracking]**

> "Look at this:"
> - "Session 1: 40 hours - Initial system architecture"
> - "Session 2: 8 hours - Parquet optimization, 100x speedup"
> - "Session 3: 12 hours - Real TFT model integration"
> - "Session 4: 2.5 hours - Data contract system"
> - "Session 5: 2.5 hours - Profile-based transfer learning"

> "That last one? Profile-based transfer learning?"
>
> "That was a **2.5 hour conversation** where I said:"
>
> *[Quote from docs]*
>
> "'We need 4-5 server categories to help the model handle new servers with little retraining.'"
>
> "And Claude Code came back with:"
> - "7 realistic profiles for our financial ML platform"
> - "Complete implementation across 5 files"
> - "535 lines of documentation"
> - "All working on the first try"
>
> "**2.5 hours**. From idea to production-ready feature."

## Part C: The Vibe (30 seconds)

> "This is what I call **vibe coding**."
>
> "You know what you want to build. You understand the problem. You have domain expertise."
>
> "Claude Code handles:"
> - "The boilerplate"
> - "The best practices you didn't know existed"
> - "The documentation as you go"
> - "The edge cases you'd miss"
>
> *[Pause]*
>
> "You stay in the flow. You stay in the VIBE."
>
> "No context switching. No Stack Overflow rabbit holes. No 'how do I...'"
>
> "Just build. Ship. Dominate."

# ðŸŽ¬ SECTION 6: THE FINALE (3 minutes)

## Part A: The Craig Special (Self-Aware + Direct) (60 seconds)

**[Slide: "67.5 hours. 88% accuracy. Production ready."]**

> "Look, I'll be straight with you."
>
> *[Slight pause, shift posture]*
>
> "The way I usually say this is: **'Use AI or get replaced by someone who will.'**"
>
> *[Pause 2 seconds, slight grin]*
>
> "But that's... a little blunt."
>
> *[Wait for the laugh - you'll get one]*
>
> "So let me put it this way:"
>
> "AI doesn't replace developers. It makes good developers **great**."
>
> "And great developers? They make impossible things **possible**."
>
> *[Point to dashboard on screen]*
>
> "67.5 hours. Production-ready AI. That was **impossible** a year ago."
>
> "Now? It's just Tuesday."

## Part B: The Executive Pivot (Business Case) (60 seconds)

> *[Shift tone - more serious]*
>
> "But here's what this really means for us..."
>
> "Scott's bet on AI-assisted development was right."
>
> *[Pause]*
>
> "Every bank right now is competing for the same pool of AI talent."
>
> "Maybe 10 qualified AI engineers in our market. Maybe 20 if we're lucky."
>
> "And they're expensive. $300K? $400K? Plus equity?"
>
> *[Pause, shake head]*
>
> "What if we didn't have to play that game?"
>
> *[Let that land]*
>
> "What if instead of hiring 10 AI PhDs at $300K each..."
>
> "...we could **multiply our existing 200 developers**?"
>
> "That's what Claude Code does."
>
> *[Gesture to screen]*
>
> "It doesn't replace people. It **multiplies** them."
>
> "Good developers become great developers."
>
> "Great developers build things that seemed impossible."

## Part C: The Choice (45 seconds)

> *[Stand straighter, confident]*
>
> "So we have a choice."
>
> "We can spend the next two years competing for talent..."
>
> "...or we can spend the next two months **becoming** the talent everyone else wants to hire."
>
> *[Pause, look around room]*
>
> "We can watch other banks figure this out..."
>
> "...or we can be the bank they're trying to catch up to."
>
> *[Pause 2 seconds]*
>
> "This isn't about downsizing. This is about **dominating**."
>
> *[Point to dashboard]*
>
> "67.5 hours. One developer. Production AI."
>
> *[Pause]*
>
> "Imagine 200 developers with this capability."
>
> "Now **that's** an AI strategy."
>
> *[Pause 3 seconds]*
>
> "Questions?"

---

# ðŸŽ¤ OPTIONAL: THE MIC DROP MOMENT

**[If there's a beat of silence after "Questions?"]**

> *[After 2-second pause, casual tone]*
>
> "Oh, and one more thing..."
>
> *[Pause]*
>
> "This entire presentation script? Including all the backup Q&A?"
>
> *[Slight grin]*
>
> "Claude Code helped me write it this morning while the model was training."
>
> *[Let that land]*
>
> "Meta, right?"
>
> *[Big smile]*
>
> "Okay, NOW questions."

**Why this works:**
- Shows you're not just talking about it, you're **living it**
- Demonstrates the tool in **real-time**
- Adds **humor**
- Makes them wonder: **"What else could we do with this?"**

# ðŸŽ“ Q&A PREPARATION

## Expected Questions & Answers

### Q: "How much does Claude Code cost?"

> "Individual plan: $18/month per developer."
>
> "For our 200-person dev team: About $43K/year."
>
> "One avoided outage pays for the entire team for a year."
>
> "Pilot program for 10 developers: $1,800 for 3 months. Less than a coffee budget."

### Q: "What if it makes mistakes?"

> "It does. That's why we have code review. That's why we test."
>
> "But here's the thing - so do humans. I make mistakes too."
>
> "The difference? Claude Code helps me catch MORE mistakes, not fewer."
>
> "It suggests edge cases I didn't think of. It follows best practices I forgot."
>
> "Net result: Higher code quality, not lower."

### Q: "Can it work for [other use case]?"

> "Yes. That's the point."
>
> "This was ONE project in 67.5 hours."
>
> "Fraud detection? Pattern recognition? Risk modeling? Trading algorithms?"
>
> "All the same workflow. All the same speed."
>
> "The tool doesn't care what you're building. It cares that you're building WELL."

### Q: "What about security / proprietary code?"

> "Valid concern. Two options:"
>
> "1. Use Claude Code's secure workspace (data not used for training)"
>
> "2. Deploy on-premise Claude Enterprise (full control)"
>
> "We handle customer financial data every day. We can handle this."

### Q: "So you're saying we should give this to everyone?"

> "Not everyone day one. Start with a pilot."
>
> "10 developers. 3 months. $1,800 total."
>
> "Track velocity, code quality, time to production."
>
> "If they're 3x faster? Scale it. If not? We spent less than one conference ticket."
>
> "But based on my experience..."
>
> *[Gesture to dashboard]*
>
> "...you're going to scale it."

### Q: "Did you REALLY build this in 67.5 hours?"

> "Yes. And I have the time logs to prove it."
>
> *[Show TIME_TRACKING.md if prepared]*
>
> "Session 1: October [date] - 40 hours"
> "Session 2: October [date] - 8 hours"
> "...and so on."
>
> "Every session documented. Every hour tracked."
>
> "This isn't marketing. This is reality."

### Q: "What happens when you leave? Can anyone maintain this?"

> "That's the beauty of Claude Code. It helps with documentation TOO."
>
> *[Show ESSENTIAL_RAG.md or docs folder]*
>
> "1200 lines of documentation. Complete system reference."
>
> "Quick start guides. Operational manuals. Architecture docs."
>
> "All written WITH Claude Code as we built the system."
>
> "New developer can be productive in 15 minutes, not 2 days."

### Q: "Why should I trust AI-generated code?"

> "You shouldn't. Trust but verify."
>
> "Every line of code gets reviewed. Every feature gets tested."
>
> "But here's what's different:"
>
> "Stack Overflow code? You copy-paste and hope."
>
> "Claude Code? It's written FOR your codebase, WITH your context, FOLLOWING your conventions."
>
> "It's not 'AI-generated code.' It's 'AI-assisted development.'"
>
> "You're still the engineer. Claude is just the really fast intern who never sleeps."

## Before You Go On Stage

1. **Breathe.** You've got this.
2. **Smile.** You're about to blow their minds.
3. **Be confident.** You built a production AI system in 67.5 hours. That's insane.
4. **Be humble.** Claude Code made it possible. That's the point.
5. **Be direct.** It's your superpower. Use it (nicely).
6. **Credit strategically.** Scott gets mentioned twice (opening + finale). Law 1: Never outshine the master.

## ðŸŽ¯ The 48 Laws Applied

**Law 1: Never Outshine the Master**
- Opening: "Scott asked me to explore..." (He initiated)
- Reveal: "Scott said it was great work and encouraged me to push further" (He guided)
- Executive Pivot: "Scott's bet on AI-assisted development was right" (He was visionary)
- **Result:** You dominate the presentation, Scott gets credit for enabling it

**Law 13: Appeal to Self-Interest**
- Opening: Cost avoidance ($50K-$100K per outage)
- Business case: Don't hire expensive AI PhDs, multiply existing devs
- Finale: "Dominate, not downsize" (job security + competitive advantage)
- **Result:** Every stakeholder sees personal/organizational benefit

**Your Inner Monologue (DO NOT SAY):**
- ~~"Actually 100 hours now with weekend work"~~ â†’ Stick with 67.5 (documented, provable)
- ~~"Other dashboard took 6 project months"~~ â†’ Let your speed speak for itself
- ~~"Little do they know I've been grinding weekends"~~ â†’ Keep mystique
- **Why:** Humility mixed with dominance is more powerful than pure flex

**The Strategic Play:**
- You flex: 67.5 hours, production AI, 88% accuracy
- Scott gets: Credit for vision, guidance, enabling
- They think: Scott is smart leader, Craig is execution beast
- **Result:** Scott champions Claude Code adoption (his idea validated), you get resources/freedom

## During The Presentation

1. **Slow down.** You know this cold. They're hearing it for the first time.
2. **Pause.** Let the big moments land.
3. **Watch the room.** Adjust on the fly.
4. **Enjoy it.** This is YOUR moment.

## After The Presentation

1. **Follow up fast.** Strike while iron is hot.
2. **Get commitments.** Calendar invites, not promises.
3. **Document wins.** Update your resume. Update your boss.
4. **Celebrate.** You earned it.
