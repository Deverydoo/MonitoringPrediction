# Session Summary - October 11, 2025 (Final)

**Date**: October 11, 2025
**Duration**: Extended session
**Status**: System ready for user-managed training

---

## 🎯 Session Objectives Completed

### 1. ✅ Created "Start Fresh" Cell in Notebook
- **Location**: [_StartHere.ipynb](../_StartHere.ipynb) - Cell 0
- **Purpose**: Complete system reset for clean training runs
- **What it does**:
  - Deletes ALL training data (`./training/*.parquet`)
  - Deletes ALL models (`./models/*`)
  - Deletes ALL checkpoints (`./checkpoints/*`)
  - Deletes ALL logs (`./logs/*`, `./lightning_logs/*`)
  - Recreates clean directories
  - Provides size/file count feedback

### 2. ✅ Conducted Complete Pipeline Audit
- **Trigger**: User started fresh after deleting all artifacts
- **Audit Scope**: Dataset generation → Training → Inference
- **Reference Document**: [DATA_CONTRACT.md](../Docs/DATA_CONTRACT.md)

**Audit Results - ALL COMPONENTS COMPLIANT**:
- ✅ [data_validator.py](../data_validator.py:20-29) - 8 states correct
- ✅ [tft_inference.py](../tft_inference.py:445-454) - 8 states, 7 profiles correct
- ✅ [metrics_generator.py](../metrics_generator.py:46-55) - 8 states, 7 profiles correct
- ✅ Training logs - Confirmed 7 profiles detected, 87,080 parameters

### 3. ✅ Enhanced Dashboard with POC Vision Tabs
- **Location**: [tft_dashboard_web.py](../tft_dashboard_web.py)
- **Added 3 New Tabs** (per user request - "grand slam features"):

#### Tab 5: Cost Avoidance Dashboard (💰)
- ROI calculator showing project pays for itself
- Configurable cost assumptions
- Daily/Monthly/Annual projections
- Shows "months to ROI"
- **Note**: Uses "would have" language for POC

#### Tab 6: Auto-Remediation Strategy (🤖)
- Profile-specific remediation actions
- Integration points (Spectrum Conductor API, Database APIs, etc.)
- Estimated time to remediate
- Shows what "would be triggered"
- **Note**: Demonstrates vision without full implementation

#### Tab 7: Alerting & Notification Strategy (📱)
- Intelligent alert routing based on severity
- Escalation paths (PagerDuty, Slack, Email)
- Alert routing matrix
- Shows who "would be contacted"
- **Note**: POC vision demonstration

### 4. ✅ Enhanced Notebook Documentation
- **Added comprehensive server profile descriptions** to [_StartHere.ipynb](../_StartHere.ipynb)
- Visual guide for 7 server profiles with resource patterns
- Financial market temporal patterns table
- Serves as both audience reference and presenter notes for live demo

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis: Dimension Mismatch Errors

### Problem Identified
```
RuntimeError: size mismatch for input_embeddings.embeddings.profile.weight:
  copying a param with shape torch.Size([8, 5]) from checkpoint,
  the shape in current model is torch.Size([7, 5])
```

### Root Causes Found:
1. **Old checkpoint files** with different architecture (8 profiles + 9 states)
2. **Old model files** from previous training runs
3. **Multiple concurrent training processes** causing conflicts

### Solutions Applied:
1. ✅ Created "Start Fresh" cell to ensure clean slate
2. ✅ Deleted old model `models/tft_model_20251011_215451` (had wrong architecture)
3. ✅ Verified all pipeline components use correct architecture:
   - 7 profiles: `ml_compute, database, web_api, conductor_mgmt, data_ingest, risk_analytics, generic`
   - 8 states: `critical_issue, healthy, heavy_load, idle, maintenance, morning_spike, offline, recovery`

---

## 📊 Current System Status

### Architecture (Confirmed Correct)
- **Profiles**: 7 (transfer learning enabled)
- **States**: 8 (from DATA_CONTRACT.md v1.0.0)
- **Model Parameters**: 87,080
- **Hash-based server encoding**: Stable across fleet changes

### Training Status
- ⏳ **User has active training running** (1.7GB Python process - PID 39312)
- ✅ Using fresh dataset with correct architecture
- ✅ Will produce model compatible with inference daemon
- 📍 Training is **user's responsibility** to complete

### Files Ready for Demo (3 days)
- ✅ [_StartHere.ipynb](../_StartHere.ipynb) - Enhanced with Cell 0 "Start Fresh" + profile descriptions
- ✅ [tft_dashboard_web.py](../tft_dashboard_web.py) - Added Tabs 5, 6, 7 for POC vision
- ✅ [DATA_CONTRACT.md](../Docs/DATA_CONTRACT.md) - Single source of truth
- ✅ All pipeline components audited and compliant

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL NOTES FOR FUTURE SESSIONS

### **DO NOT RUN THESE - USER'S RESPONSIBILITY:**

1. **❌ DO NOT run training**
   - Training takes 2-10 hours depending on epochs/data
   - User needs control over when this happens
   - User will run via notebook Cell 6 when ready

2. **❌ DO NOT create/generate datasets**
   - Dataset generation can take 5-10+ minutes for large datasets
   - User needs control over data parameters
   - User will run via notebook Cell 4 when ready

3. **❌ DO NOT run any time-consuming processes without explicit user request**
   - User must initiate and monitor long-running tasks
   - Assistant role: setup, configuration, debugging, analysis
   - User role: execution of resource-intensive operations

### **ASSISTANT RESPONSIBILITIES:**
- ✅ Code review and debugging
- ✅ Configuration and setup
- ✅ Documentation and explanations
- ✅ Quick file operations (read, edit, write)
- ✅ System status checks
- ✅ Architecture verification
- ✅ Error diagnosis

---

## 🚀 Next Steps for User

### Before Live Demo (3 days):

1. **Complete Training** (User's task)
   - Current training in progress will create fresh model
   - Should complete in ~2-3 hours
   - Will save to `./models/` with correct architecture

2. **Test Inference Daemon**
   ```bash
   python tft_inference.py --daemon --port 8000 --fleet-size 25
   ```
   - Should work once new model is trained
   - No more dimension mismatch errors

3. **Test Web Dashboard**
   ```bash
   streamlit run tft_dashboard_web.py
   ```
   - Verify all 7 tabs work
   - Verify new POC vision tabs (5, 6, 7)

4. **Practice Notebook Demo Flow**
   - Cell 0: Show "Start Fresh" capability (don't run)
   - Cells 1-3: Setup and validation
   - Cell 4: Explain dataset generation (already done)
   - Cell 5: Show profile visualizations
   - Cell 6: Explain training (already done)
   - Cell 7: Inspect trained model

## 🔧 Quick Reference Commands

### Fresh Start (when needed)
```bash
# Run Cell 0 in notebook to wipe everything clean
# Then regenerate data and retrain
```

### Check Training Status
```bash
tasklist | findstr python
# Look for large memory usage process
```

### Start Inference Daemon
```bash
conda activate py310
python tft_inference.py --daemon --port 8000 --fleet-size 25
```

### Launch Dashboard
```bash
streamlit run tft_dashboard_web.py
```

### Verify Pipeline Components
- Check [DATA_CONTRACT.md](../Docs/DATA_CONTRACT.md) for source of truth
- All components must use: 7 profiles, 8 states

## 📝 Key Technical Decisions

1. **Profile-Based Transfer Learning**: Enabled via static_categorical feature
2. **Hash-Based Server Encoding**: SHA256 for stable server IDs
3. **Data Contract v1.0.0**: Immutable schema for entire pipeline
4. **Safetensors**: Secure model serialization
5. **POC Vision Approach**: Use "would have" language to show capabilities without overbuilding
