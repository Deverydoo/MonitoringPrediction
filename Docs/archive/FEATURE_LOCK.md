**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete
- Streamlit-based web interface
- Real-time metric visualization
- **Interactive scenario control** (Healthy/Degrading/Critical)
- Server state override system
- Prediction confidence visualization

- Fleet overview

**Demo Impact**: üî•üî•üî• **SHOCK AND AWE** - Live scenario manipulation!

### Key Differentiators (Why This Demo Wins)

#### 1. **Interactive Scenario System** üéØ
Most demos show static predictions. We let the audience **control the environment**:
- "Let's degrade server ppweb001 right now"
- Watch predictions update in real-time
- Show how model responds to different scenarios
- **THIS IS THE KILLER FEATURE**

#### 2. **Production-Ready Architecture** üèóÔ∏è
Not a Jupyter notebook demo. This is **real infrastructure**:
- Daemon services
- REST + WebSocket APIs
- Hot-reload without downtime
- Async/threading for performance
- Health checks and monitoring

#### 3. **Deep Learning Model** üß†
Not ARIMA or simple regression:
- Temporal Fusion Transformer (Google Research)
- Attention mechanisms
- Multi-horizon predictions (8 hours)
- Profile-based transfer learning
- State-of-the-art architecture

#### 4. **Enterprise-Grade Features** üíº
- Server profiles (database, web, ML compute)
- State management (healthy ‚Üí degrading ‚Üí critical)
- Contract validation (data quality checks)
- GPU optimization
- Encoder persistence for production scalability

## Demo Flow (5-10 Minutes)

### Opening (30 seconds)
"We built a predictive monitoring system that forecasts server issues 8 hours in advance using deep learning."

### Act 1: Show Healthy State (1 minute)
- Open dashboard
- Show fleet overview - all servers healthy
- Explain prediction horizon (8 hours ahead)
- Point out confidence scores

### Act 2: Interactive Scenario - The Showstopper (3 minutes)
**"Let me show you something cool - we can simulate real-world scenarios"**

1. **Select server**: "Let's pick ppdb002 - a critical database server"
2. **Choose scenario**: "I'm going to trigger a degrading state - simulating increasing load"
3. **Click button**: "Watch what happens..."
4. **Wait for prediction update** (10-15 seconds)
5. **Show the change**:
   - CPU predictions rising
   - Confidence scores adjusting
   - Model detecting the trend
6. **Push it further**: "Now let's go critical - simulating a major issue"
7. **Show cascading effects**: Multiple metrics spike
8. **Return to healthy**: "And we can restore it instantly"

**Impact**: üî• Audience sees the model respond in real-time to live changes

### Act 3: Technical Deep Dive (2 minutes)
**"How does this work?"**

- TFT model architecture (attention mechanisms)
- 8-hour prediction horizon
- Profile-based learning (database servers behave differently than web servers)
- GPU acceleration
- Production-ready REST API

### Act 4: Real-World Value (1 minute)
**"Why does this matter?"**

- Predict outages before they happen
- Proactive capacity planning
- Reduce MTTR (Mean Time To Resolution)
- Prevent revenue loss from downtime
- Empower SAs and DevOps teams

### Closing (30 seconds)
**"Questions?"**

## Known Issues (To Be Fixed)

### High Priority üî¥

1. **Encoder Persistence Validation** (Current Session)
   - Status: Fix implemented, needs validation
   - Impact: Model only predicts 8/20 servers without fix
   - Timeline: Validate after user retrains model
   - File: [tft_trainer.py:783-792](../tft_trainer.py#L783-L792), [tft_inference.py:397-453](../tft_inference.py#L397-L453)

### Medium Priority üü°

2. **Dashboard Connection Timeout** (FIXED ‚úÖ)
   - Status: Resolved via thread pool execution
   - File: [tft_inference.py](../tft_inference.py)

3. **Slow Warmup** (FIXED ‚úÖ)
   - Status: Reduced from 288 to 24 ticks
   - Impact: Startup now ~5 seconds instead of 30+

### Low Priority üü¢

4. **GPU Memory Optimization**
   - Status: Currently using 85% reserved
   - Impact: Works fine, could be more efficient
   - Future: Adjust batch size or precision

## Performance Metrics

### Current Performance ‚úÖ

- **Startup Time**: ~5 seconds (daemon ready)
- **Prediction Latency**: 2-3 seconds per batch (20 servers, 96 timesteps)
- **API Response**: <100ms for health checks
- **Dashboard Refresh**: Real-time updates every 10 seconds
- **GPU Utilization**: ~85% memory, efficient compute

### Target Performance (If Optimizing)

- **Startup Time**: <5 seconds ‚úÖ (already there)
- **Prediction Latency**: <1 second (would require model optimization)
- **API Response**: <50ms (marginal improvement)
- **Dashboard Refresh**: 5 seconds (more responsive)

‚ùå Fleet monitoring service
‚ùå Sunset server detection
‚ùå Multi-region support
‚ùå Kubernetes deployment
‚ùå A/B testing framework

‚ùå Slack/Teams notifications
‚ùå Alert management system
‚ùå Historical trend analysis
‚ùå Anomaly detection beyond predictions
‚ùå Root cause analysis
‚ùå Cost optimization features
‚ùå Multi-cloud support

**These are all great ideas. They go in FUTURE_ROADMAP.md.**
