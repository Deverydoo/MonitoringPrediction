ðŸ–¥ Host and Version Information
Field	Description
Host Name	The serverâ€™s unique hostname (e.g., ppvra00a0041). This identifies each compute host in the AIMLP OSDS 2.0 production cluster.
Agent Version	Version of the monitoring agent installed on the host (e.g., 1.5.140). This ensures consistency in metrics collection across nodes.
âš¡ Load and CPU Metrics
Field	Description
Load	The current system load per CPU core. A value of 1.0 means each core is fully utilized. For example, a 16-core system with a load of 16.0 is at 100% total load.
%CPU User	Percentage of CPU cycles spent executing user-space processes (e.g., your Java app).
%CPU Sys	Percentage of CPU cycles spent on kernel (system) tasks (e.g., I/O handling, network stack).
%CPU iowt	CPU percentage waiting for I/O operations (e.g., disk reads/writes). High values can indicate I/O bottlenecks.
%CPU Idle	Percentage of time CPU is idle. Lower values indicate higher utilization. A healthy idle value depends on workload.
â˜• Application Load
Field	Description
Java CPU	Amount of CPU time (in milliseconds or relative metric) consumed by Java processes running on the host. Often comes from JVM or monitoring agents.
Total Procs	Total number of processes currently running on the system. High counts can indicate service sprawl or runaway jobs.
ðŸ§  Memory and Swap
Field	Description
%Mem Used	Percentage of physical RAM used. High usage with low swap may indicate expected caching behavior; sustained 90%+ can be a concern.
%Swap	Percentage of swap space in use. High swap usage often indicates memory pressure.
Mem	Total physical memory in MB (e.g., 2517 MB).
Swap	Total swap memory in MB (e.g., 16.0 MB).
ðŸ’¾ Disk and Network
Field	Description
Disk Usage	Percentage of disk space used on the monitored filesystem (here, /aimlp_work).
Mb/s In	Incoming network throughput in megabits per second. Useful for identifying network saturation or spikes.
Mb/s Out	Outgoing network throughput in megabits per second.
ðŸ•“ Process Wait Metrics
Field	Description
Back Close Wait	Count of backend processes in close wait state (likely TCP connections awaiting closure). Persistent non-zero values can indicate network handling issues.
Front Close Wait	Count of frontend processes in close wait state. Same idea as above but for inbound connections.
ðŸ•’ System Uptime and Load Trends
Field	Description
Uptime Days	Number of days the server has been running since its last reboot. Useful for identifying long-running instances.
Load Aver	The average system load over the last period (likely 1 or 5 minutes). This gives a quick view of sustained CPU pressure.
Last Update	Timestamp of the last time metrics were collected from the host. Ensures data freshness.
ðŸ§® Resource Configuration
Field	Description
CPU	Number of CPU cores available on the host. (e.g., 16 cores).

âœ… How this data is typically used in operations:

CPU Load + Java CPU â†’ Identify hosts under heavy compute load.

%CPU iowt + Disk Usage â†’ Detect I/O bottlenecks.

%Mem Used + %Swap â†’ Spot memory pressure and potential thrashing.

Load Average vs CPU cores â†’ Assess if a server is overloaded.

Front/Back Close Wait â†’ Detect network stack issues or slow service shutdowns.

Uptime Days + Agent Version â†’ Find outdated or long-running hosts needing maintenance.
