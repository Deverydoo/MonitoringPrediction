## 💡 Key Decisions Made

### 1. Email-Only Contact

**Decision:** No contact forms, just email (craig@nordiqai.io)

**Rationale:**
- More personal and authentic
- Reinforces "human connection" brand
- Simpler for prospects (no friction)
- Direct access to founder

**Alternative Considered:** Contact form with qualification fields
**Why Rejected:** Creates friction, feels corporate

### 2. Transparent Pricing

**Decision:** Show actual prices on website

**Rationale:**
- Builds trust
- Qualifies leads (budget awareness)
- Differentiator vs. "Contact us for pricing" competitors
- SMB-friendly

**Alternative Considered:** Hide pricing, force demo requests
**Why Rejected:** Creates bad UX, loses smaller leads

### 3. Static HTML Site

**Decision:** Pure HTML/CSS/JS (no frameworks)

**Rationale:**
- Fast loading (<1s)
- Apache-native
- No build step
- Easy to maintain
- Version controlled

**Alternative Considered:** React/Next.js, WordPress
**Why Rejected:** Overkill for static content, slower

### 4. Nordic Minimalist Design

**Decision:** Clean, simple, professional aesthetic

**Rationale:**
- Reflects brand ("Nordic precision")
- Fast loading (minimal assets)
- Professional appearance
- Executive-friendly

**Alternative Considered:** Bold, colorful, modern tech look
**Why Rejected:** Doesn't align with "precision" brand
