        st.markdown("""
        ### 1. Automated Retraining Pipeline ⭐⭐⭐
        **Priority**: HIGH | **Effort**: 2-3 weeks | **Value**: Production-critical

        Automatically detect fleet changes and retrain model when needed.

        **Features**:
        - Fleet drift monitoring (new/sunset servers detected)
        - Unknown prediction rate tracking
        - Automatic dataset regeneration from live metrics
        - Scheduled retraining workflows (nightly/weekly)
        - Blue-green model deployment with validation
        - Automatic rollback on validation failure

        **Business Value**: Zero-touch model maintenance, always-accurate predictions, scales to 1000+ servers

        ---

        ### 2. Action Recommendation System ⭐⭐⭐
        **Priority**: HIGH | **Effort**: 4-6 weeks | **Value**: Game-changer

        Context-aware recommendations for predicted issues.

        **Recommendation Types**:
        - **Immediate Actions** (0-2h): "Scale web tier +2 servers", "Restart hung process", "Clear cache"
        - **Short-Term Actions** (2-8h): "Schedule deployment rollback", "Increase connection pool"
        - **Long-Term Actions** (1-7 days): "Optimize slow query", "Add database index"
        - **Preventive Actions**: "Schedule maintenance before predicted spike"

        **Confidence Scoring**: Action effectiveness, risk level, time required, reversibility

        **Business Value**: Reduce decision paralysis, empower junior SAs, faster MTTR by 70%

        ---

        ### 3. Advanced Dashboard Intelligence ⭐⭐⭐
        **Priority**: HIGH | **Effort**: 3-4 weeks | **Value**: Better UX

        **Smart Features**:
        - **Predictive Insights**: "3 servers predicted to degrade in next 8 hours - ppweb001 likely CPU bottleneck (89% confidence)"
        - **What-If Analysis**: "What if I scale up this server?" → Show prediction changes
        - **Trend Analysis**: "CPU trending up 12% week-over-week", "Memory leak detected"
        - **Intelligent Sorting**: Auto-prioritize by risk, group by profile, filter by confidence
        - **Comparison View**: Server vs server, current vs predicted, different scenarios

        **Business Value**: Faster decisions, reduced cognitive load, proactive operations

        ---

        ### 4. Alerting Integration ⭐⭐⭐
        **Priority**: HIGH | **Effort**: 1-2 weeks | **Value**: Essential

        **Integrations**:
        - PagerDuty (create incidents for high-confidence predictions)
        - Slack (send notifications to channels)
        - Microsoft Teams (adaptive cards)
        - Email (digest emails)
        - JIRA/ServiceNow (auto-create tickets)

        **Smart Alerting**: Only actionable predictions, confidence-based routing, time-to-impact urgency, deduplication

        **Business Value**: Integrate with existing workflows, reduce alert fatigue, right alert at right time

        ---

        ### 5. Explainable AI (XAI) ⭐⭐⭐
        **Priority**: HIGH | **Effort**: 3-4 weeks | **Value**: Trust & transparency

        **Techniques**:
        - SHAP values (feature importance)
        - Attention weights (which timesteps matter most)
        - Counterfactual explanations ("if X was lower, prediction would change")

        **Example Output**:
        ```
        Prediction: ppweb001 CPU → 92% in 6 hours

        Explanation:
        ⭐⭐⭐ Recent trend (last 4h): +15% CPU increase
        ⭐⭐ Historical pattern: Morning spike approaching (8 AM in 6h)
        ⭐⭐ Similar servers: ppweb002/003 also trending up
        ⭐ Deployment correlation: New release 2h ago
        ```

        **Business Value**: Build trust, debug model errors, regulatory compliance, educational for SAs

    ### 🚀 Next Steps

    This roadmap transforms an impressive demo into a **market-leading predictive monitoring platform**. The key is:

    1. ✅ **Start with the demo** (already killer - you're seeing it now!)
    2. **Validate with real users** (get feedback from SAs, app owners, management)
    3. **Prioritize ruthlessly** (build what matters most based on user needs)
    4. **Ship iteratively** (release Phase 1 features one at a time, learn fast)

    **The interactive scenario system is your differentiator.** Everything else enhances that core value proposition:
    **predict issues before they happen, and tell people what to do about it**.
