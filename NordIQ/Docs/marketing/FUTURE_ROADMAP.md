- Service restarts (graceful restarts for degraded apps)
- Load balancer adjustments (shift traffic away from struggling servers)
- Cache clearing (automatic memory cleanup)
- Circuit breaker activation (prevent cascading failures)

**Safety Mechanisms**:
- Confidence threshold (only act on high-confidence predictions)
- Approval workflows (require human confirmation for critical actions)
- Rollback capability (undo automated changes)

## Closing Thoughts

This roadmap transforms a impressive demo into a **market-leading predictive monitoring platform**. The key is:

1. **Start with the demo** (already killer)
2. **Validate with real users** (get feedback)
3. **Prioritize ruthlessly** (build what matters most)
4. **Ship iteratively** (release often, learn fast)

The interactive scenario system is your differentiator. Everything else enhances that core value proposition: **predict issues before they happen, and tell people what to do about it**.

üöÄ **Let's build the future of monitoring.**
